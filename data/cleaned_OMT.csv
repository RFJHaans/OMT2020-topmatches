10023,"Struggling To Make Sense Of It All: The Emotional Process Of Sensemaking In Scrutinized Occupations -- This paper examines the practice world of practitioners working in ‘scrutinized’ occupations through a qualitative study of emergency management practitioners who were involved in a major bushfire incident, participated in the subsequent public inquiry, and were responsible for the implementation of the inquiry’s recommendations. We show how such practitioners engage with their practice world through three different ‘modes of involvement’ as a result of a cycle of scrutiny that flows from the incident, through the inquiry, to implementation. We also explore the different emotions experienced by these practitioners during this process and draw attention to the important role of one particular emotion – anxiety – which takes different forms depending on the particular mode of involvement. Our findings indicate that anxiety helps practitioners deal with scrutiny by facilitating sensemaking and developing knowledge, allowing us to develop a general model of sensemaking and emotion in scrutinized occupations more broadly."
10035,"Breaking Organizational Silence -- It is a common practice in organizations for employees to withhold or distort—“sugarcoat”—some of their opinions, especially when these opinions concern unpleasant news that needs to be communicated to managers. However, sometimes such withholding of information grows into the pervasive silencing of issues and this may have detrimental effects on the business as well as the well-being of organizational members. Therefore, it is important for both practitioners and scholars to understand how organizations might reverse the negative dynamics around such silenced issues. With this paper, we describe one of the ways in which organizations may break the silence and contribute to the theoretical understanding of the process. We draw on a unique ethnographic study dataset, in which, at the time of the observation, employees collaborated with their managers, and attempted to break the silence surrounding a particularly problematic organizational issue. We trace the process of how anxiety around the silenced issue built up in the organization, and how attempts to break the silence culminated in a metaphorical, humorous, and hyperbolized public revelation. These findings show the importance of courage, strategic use of humor and adaptive planning, and contribute to the understanding of socio-organizational practices around the complex issues embedded in organizational cultures."
10036,"Uncertainty as Generated through Social Practices in Biotechnology Entrepreneuring -- In this paper, we extend the research on entrepreneurial uncertainty by applying a practice lens, and analyzing how uncertainty is generated in entrepreneuring practices. Contrary to the established notion of uncertainty as a characteristic of environment or as an individual knowledge problem, we analyze uncertainty as a social phenomenon and a part of social entrepreneuring practices. We draw on the entrepreneurship as practice approach and analyze how practices of creating “proof of concept”—the feasibility of a new technology—generate uncertainty, and how entrepreneurial firms organize in response to this uncertainty in order to break the tension that surrounds the creation of a “proof of concept”. Based on a comprehensive study of a large biotechnology firm and the network of entrepreneurial firms that are their partners or potential collaborators, we demonstrate how uncertainty manifests through contrasting understanding of time and knowing."
10053,"Influences of Top Managers’ Pay Dispersions on Organizational Responses to Performance Shortfalls -- The behavioral theory of the firm has been tested across various organizational change settings. This literature shows that firms pursue change when performance drops below aspirations, but relatively scarce research examines how pay dispersions of the dominant coalition influence this process. Integrating insights from behavioral theory and pay dispersion research and applying them to the business divestiture context, we propose that top executives facing total pay dispersions likely experience team conflicts and dissatisfaction, attenuating divestiture rate in response to performance shortfalls. Managers with distinct time horizons, however, exhibit varying behaviors whereby unexercisable option pay dispersion weakens divestiture rate due to widening pay gap over the long-term whereas exercisable options and stock pay dispersions foster divestiture tendencies to improve short-term performance and close the pay gap."
10089,"Historical Political Ideology and Firm Innovation: Worldwide Evidence of R&D Investments (1982-2016) -- Dominant national political ideology during founding or initial public offering (IPO) shapes a firm’s structures and routines—leaving an organizational ideological imprint—and persistently affects firms’ innovation. I argue that the communist (capitalist) ideological imprint discourages (encourages) firms’ innovation enduringly. To triangulate the theoretical mechanism, I argue that the communist (capitalist) ideological imprint weakens (strengthens) the impact of two determinants of innovation, i.e. competitive aspirations and organizational slack. Meanwhile, I differentiate types of sensitive periods when imprinting processes take place and argue that founding imprint is more powerful than its IPO counterpart. Finally, I suggest that the subsequent IPO imprint modifies the influence of founding imprint, and therefore imprinting is a punctuated process. Empirical analysis of a longitudinal sample of worldwide firms’ research and development (R&D) investment supports my hypotheses. My study contributes to imprinting theory and strategy literature."
10091,"Organization of Production and Labor Income Inequality -- This paper investigates how and why the organization of production (relative sizes of occupational groups, distribution of firm sizes), can be correlated with measures of income inequality (GINI, income in the top 1%) in market economies, where individuals with different skills make occupational choices as employees, solo self-employed, or entrepreneur-managers. We identify the parameters of the production technology, the organizational costs, and the distribution of skills in the population that jointly determine the size of occupational groups and the level of inequality in the distribution of income in the market equilibrium. The comparative static analysis reveals the contribution to income inequality of “market” and “organization”."
10096,"Historical Protestant Influence, Subnational Institutions, and Organizational Structure in the U.S. -- I argue that variation across U.S. states regarding historical Protestant influence leads to discernible subnational institutions. These varying institutional patterns among states in turn lead to differences in organizational structures of firms. I also suggest that Catholic activities tend to reshape the historical Protestant influence. Using a hand-collected longitudinal dataset of states from 1776 to 2017 and a panel dataset of publicly traded firms in the U.S. from 1992 to 2017, I found that historical Protestant influence results in flatter hierarchy and greater gender equality in firms, partly through formal and informal institutions that promote liberalism and equality. This effect is weakened by the role of Catholic immigrants through political contestation. Finally, the Catholic reform in 1960s diminished the Protestantism-Catholicism divide, thereby reducing the dampening effect of Catholic immigrants on the historical Protestant influence. My study contributes to (1) institutional theory by unraveling the emergence and evolution of subnational institutions through a religious lens, (2) imprinting perspective by considering the dynamics introduced by counter-imprinting entities (i.e., the Catholic activities), and (3) literature on organizational structure by revealing overlooked antecedents from the nexus of history, religion, and institution."
10126,"Solidarity All Around: How Spatial Context Influences Perceptions of Organizational Solidarity -- More than seventy years of research in social networks and microgeography have shown that spa- tial proximity offers individuals opportunities to interact and form social ties, aggregating up to a structural influence of the arrangement of space on social networks among organization members. But space has the power to do more than structure opportunities for individuals to interact directly. Spatial design also structures opportunities to observe others’ interactions, an extra-network in- formation channel that may influence social perceptions, and consequently the way individuals relate to their organization. One important way in which individuals relate to their organization is the degree to which they perceive it as a strong ‘community’, where their colleagues are mutually supportive and socially cohesive, best captured by the long-established concept of social solidar- ity. Social solidarity has largely been conceived of as arising from social interactions and social network structures among workers. We present an extra-network information theory of spatial ar- rangement’s influence on individual perceptions of social solidarity in their organization. Testing this theory in the context of a North American financial technology company, our results suggest that there is indeed an influence of spatial arrangements on perceptions of social solidarity. This apparent influence of spatial context is not mediated via the social network among workers, suggesting that spatial design may be able to directly influence the way in which workers relate to their organization."
10129,"The Uncertain and the Unexpected:Pathways to the Evolution of Job Structures in the Throes of Hiring -- In this paper, we examine the evolution of job structures in the throes of the hiring process – how jobs change in the time between making a decision to bring in someone to do a body of work and officially hiring someone. We analyze interviews about startup hiring and find that during hiring tasks are added and removed from jobs, jobs are abandoned, replaced, and moved, and hiring processes are re-launched. There are three pathways for this evolution, each shaped by a form of the uncertain or the unexpected: not knowing about what the job should be; lacking understanding of labor markets; and unexpected events. Not surprisingly, most of the jobs on these pathways are new to their organizations but contrary to common conceptions, these processes are not the product of managers who lack experience or who use lax hiring practices. The pathways differ in their longer-term consequences."
10146,"The Role of Proto-forms in the Emergence of Historic Movie Theaters in Chicago Communities:1896-1962 -- We develop a novel concept of proto-form to understand the “pre-birth” processes of organizational form emergence, which take place between the discovery of a technological or social novelty and the eventual emergence of organizational forms dedicated to exploiting this novelty. We define a proto-form as a provisional organizational form that arises when entrepreneurs and enthusiasts experiment with possible applications of a novelty by using preexisting organizational forms as a basis. Proto-forms are a key step in the emergence of dedicated organizational forms, because they provide audiences with initial understandings of the novelty’s socio-cultural meanings. We theorize that the cultural status of proto-forms can affect how quickly dedicated forms with either similar or dissimilar cultural status emerge in geographic communities. Using data on all historic movie-showing venues in Chicago, Illinois, 1896-1962, we predicted and found that the proliferation of proto-forms with low cultural status in a community accelerated the emergence of dedicated organizational forms with low cultural status and delayed the emergence of dedicated forms with high cultural status. We predicted the opposite for the proliferation of proto-forms with high cultural status and found partial support to this prediction. These results provide initial evidence for the important role of proto-forms in understanding the emergence of new organizational forms."
10170,"Seeing Through the Lens of Event Stigma: Media Evaluations of Referees in the Aftermath of a Scandal -- We study how event stigma can shape the evaluation of the conduct of actors at the field-level. Specifically, we argue that in the aftermath of a traumatic event, event stigma breeds skepticism in a generalized fashion, so that all actors within the field should face more contestation. Moreover, we expect high-status actors to face a larger increase in the contestation levels compared to low-status ones because event stigma is associated with a generalized loss of trust, which is especially damaging to high-status actors. Finally, we argue that event stigma will translate into a stronger preference for monitoring and control; as a result, perceived failures to act (omissions) will face particular contestation, and especially so in the case of high-status actors. A study of media coverage of Italian football referees’ decisions before and after the 2006 Calciopoli scandal provides support for our arguments."
10275,"Shareholder Unrest and Its Influence on CEO Career Outcomes -- We examine the effects of shareholder unrest on CEOs’ career outcomes. Shareholder unrest –the overall scale of shareholder dissatisfaction with company practices, as manifested in support for shareholder resolutions – is a quintessential form of a broader class of performance indicators: stakeholders’ publicly-registered assessments, which are distinct from customary metrics of managerial performance, such as profitability or share price. We theorize that shareholder unrest activates the mechanisms of settling up and executive job demands, with distinct outcomes from each. Drawing on the concept of settling up, we hypothesize that shareholder unrest negatively affects the careers of incumbent CEOs, reducing pay and increasing likelihood of dismissal. Applying executive job demands theory, we hypothesize that new CEOs of unrest-laden firms receive higher initial pay packages to deal with these inherited job demands. Finally, we unpack a distinction typically overlooked by studying two broad types of resolutions, those aimed at wealth maximization and those that are CSR-oriented, theorizing that these two types of unrest exert equal effects on CEOs’ career outcomes. Testing our ideas on a longitudinal sample of U.S. corporations, we find considerable support for our hypotheses."
10280,"Indexical Judgment: The Construction of Valuation Devices for Art and Antiques -- The growth of models, metrics and indicators is a hallmark of the modern economy and contemporary markets. Yet there is little empirical research on how designers balance their goals and beliefs with the constraints and politics faced when developing important valuation devices. The special features of artworks as unique, difficult-to-value, and with a value based on social consensus, make the art market an excellent context to study such processes. Using two pioneering art price indices, the Times-Sotheby and Sotheby Index, we develop a theoretical framework to examine market indicator development. Through interviews with key figures and extensive documentary analysis, we trace the entwined forces of epistemic beliefs about the nature of value and available resources in valuation-producing organizations. The result is a process through which different modes of justification and commensurability interact as designers develop a workable set of valuation practices into systematic valuation devices. Our research contributes to research on organizational and calculative infrastructures underpinning markets, particularly in creating market indicators, and extends a growing literature linking strategy and valuation, particularly since strategic modification of indices is constrained by the need to maintain established methods for longitudinal comparison, a hallmark of many valuation devices."
10300,"Rescripting client action: Emotion work and the boundaries of professional jurisdiction -- This paper addresses a major gap in the study of professions, which is the absence of clients in research on the boundaries of professional jurisdiction. To do so, it shifts the standard analytical focus in two important ways: from inter-profession relations to the professional?client relationship; and from a profession-centered perspective to a client-centered one. Numerous empirical studies of client movements in professionalized fields such as health care, education and religion show that clients organize in many ways to redraw service arrangements and the boundaries of professional jurisdiction. Yet, one wouldn’t learn much about this phenomenon by reading existing organizational research on professionalized fields, which largely explains service arrangements and jurisdictional boundaries as resulting from inter-professional struggles for epistemic control over domains of activity, while all but ignoring client action. Building upon insights from Hirschman’s exit, voice, and loyalty framework, Mannheim’s theory of ideology and utopia, and organizational research informed by Goffman’s idea of an “interaction order”, we develop a six-part typology of client action scripts. We then elucidate how different forms of emotion work carried out in framing contests between ‘incumbent’ professionals and ‘challenger’ clients can evoke distinct felt emotions that, in turn, rescript client action toward different boundary projects."
10330,"Playing Different Games: A Dual Tournament Theory of Executive Promotions -- Despite robust research on CEOs, little is known about the non-CEO executive labor market and the promotion paths of TMT members to CEO. Tournament theory suggests employees will strive to win a promotion tournament if the pay gap is large and has generally assumed there is no relevant difference in external or internal pay gaps as the skills needed for promotion are similar across firms. However, considering the increasing prevalence of external succession in today’s executive labor market, we challenge this theoretical assumption and argue that differences in internal and external pay gaps create two separate but simultaneous tournaments for CEO promotion and propose a dual tournament theory of executive promotions. By arguing that there are two tournaments that TMT members could attend to differently based on their individual characteristics, we highlight how the same motivational theory can suggest dissimilar types of actions across TMT members in the same firm. While traditional tournament theory suggests a large CEO-TMT pay gap can be an effective governance mechanism, our dual tournament theory explains how the actions taken by TMT members pursuing external tournaments may tend towards opportunistic behaviors resulting in increased agency costs and governance issues for firms."
11421,"Stigma Entrepreneurship: Theorizing The Role Of Moral Anger In Entrepreneurship -- Negative emotions are usually described as hindrances, impediments, or discouragements of entrepreneurial action. We contend that this is not always the case, offering a new explanation of how negative emotions associated with stigmatization might spark entrepreneurial action. We argue that stigmatization, as both an individual (i.e., first-person) and collective (i.e., third-person or group) experience, generates negative emotions, particularly moral anger. We explain how moral anger can then spur an individual to start an entrepreneurial venture with the aim of reducing relevant stigma(s). In doing so, we develop a theoretical process model for what we call stigma entrepreneurship, which we define as entrepreneurial efforts primarily directed at stigma reduction. We contribute to the literatures on entrepreneurship and on stigma management by highlighting the overlooked role of entrepreneurship as a tool for stigma reduction that goes beyond individual identity management strategies or collective action. Answering calls for research on the illegitimate, the informal, and the underdog, our exploration of stigma entrepreneurship challenges conventional wisdom and expands understandings of the possibilities within entrepreneurship."
11470,"“Ella says…” How authority in eponymous firms is authored through ventriloquial acts -- This article advances ‘communicative constitution of organization’ (Ashcraft, Kuhn & Cooren, 2009: 7) understandings of how authoring authority organizes daily practice. We show how authority is eponymously authored during ventriloquial acts and produces multidirectional, temporal and fluid organizing patterns. Our ethnography of a cosmetics firm demonstrates how performative, segmented and misfiring authoring impacts quotidian activity in subtle, nuanced and precarious ways. This research also enhances communicative understandings of authority and elevates eponymy’s role within organization and management theorizing."
11499,"Hold your horses: negative anticipatory impression management and its motivations -- An emergent stream of research shows that managers engage in various impression management strategies to manage external perceptions by placing their firms in the best possible light. Drawing from this work, we develop theory around when and why managers may choose to engage in a novel form of preemptive impression management—negative anticipatory impression management (NAIM)—to recalibrate stakeholder expectations. Specifically, we posit that managers use actions and communications that deliberately convey pessimism to reduce the liability of inflated expectations. We then propose two factors—media coverage and the manager’s regulatory focus—that act as moderators. This underscores how managers use negative information to their advantage and further grounds the relevance of executive personality in impression management decision-making."
11521,"Who can start a stock exchange? Silent legitimacy, mundane materiality, and the genesis of markets -- This study presents an account of the genesis and development of two stock markets established in London in 1995. It draws on elite interviews and documentary sources to explore how the founders of these markets sought to legitimize them as stable and durable venues for security trade. The analysis accounts for the success of one market, AIM, which adopted a novel organisation and became a model for growth company markets worldwide, and the failure of the other, OFEX, despite a strategy of isomorphic conformity to the expected norms of market operation. The study uses insights from the STS-inflected study of markets to present an account of legitimacy as embedded in taken-for-granted socio-material structures. We term this phenomenon ‘silent legitimacy’. The successful market was supported by such silent legitimacy, which outweighed the ostensive strategy of isomorphic regulatory and procedural legitimacy followed by its rival. Contributing to a nascent ‘material turn’ in institutional theory, the study argues that the markets-as-institutions literature can be strengthened through theoretical engagement with the market-studies literature and empirical attention to the mundane material dimensions of institutional fields."
11530,"A macro perspective on status dynamics: The hollowing out and hallowing of Haute Couture -- Extant organizational status research has dedicated significant attention to the dynamics underlying status-based market interactions as well as the potential sources of alterations in actors’ status positions. It has, however, provided few insights into the status dynamics of an entire field. In this research, we shed light on the categorical work undertaken to preserve a category’s status over time in the context of an evolving status order. We explore our research question in the field of the French high-end fashion industry, from 1911 until today. This setting is appropriate because high-end fashion is structured by a sophisticated stratified system of categories and key actors who actively contribute to the construction and alteration of these categories. Focusing on the haute couture category, we show how, over time, the field main professional association attempted to juggle two imperatives that became increasingly at odds: maintaining the category status while ensuring its survival. We argue that such status maintenance work can only be understood by taking into account the status order in which the category is embedded, an order contested and remodeled through the joint influence of endogenous and exogenous forces."
11639,"Elaborating on the Abstract: Group Meaning-Making in a Colombian Microsavings Program -- Access to formal financial products like savings and checking accounts constitutes a hallmark feature of economic development. Across the globe, governments and other organizations promote ‘financial inclusion’ among lower-income citizens. Seeking to understand why individuals embrace or resist financial services, scholars focus on institutional, cultural, and material explanations, but pay less attention to organizations and small groups. In this study, we argue that such factors are crucial to understanding the development of financial preferences. We investigate a government-sponsored microsavings program in Colombia and find that participants became less interested in banking services over the course of the program, even as they gained access to appropriate accounts and their savings increased. Turning to qualitative data to understand this curious finding, we show that organizational efforts to disseminate abstract information about banking triggered a process of information ‘elaboration’ among group members, leading many to develop financial preferences at odds with those promoted by the government. This paper integrates insights from economic sociology, organizational theory, and microsociology to advance theories of financial preference. In doing so, it reveals how organizational efforts to compress information, followed by group efforts to personalize and expand upon it, can shape preferences and potentially undermine organizational goals."
11659,"Paradoxical Learning: A Process Study of Firefighting Innovations -- Process research increasingly emphasizes how organizations face tensions from competing demands characterized by multilevel complexity and irrationality. Although such theory development provides valuable advancements to understand paradox phenomena, it also suffers from complexity with regard to pragmatic problem-solving. This paper shows how process research can offer resolutions if feedback is added to the equation of competing demands. In particular, we focus on the complex equation of amplified innovation in knotted tensions across multiple multilevel paradoxes. Analysis of field data from the rescue service sector in Sweden and work to improve firefighting operations serve as illustrative case material. The results uncover how four types of feedback on competing demands (single-level pole, single-level paradox tension, tension-to-pole, and tension-to-tension in the context of multiple multilevel paradoxes) operate as they unfold in concurrent construction. The concurrent construction of the four feedback types triggers, reinforces, and expands learning about paradoxes. We propose that the notion of paradoxical learning captures this process and examine how multiple multilevel tensions are dealt with when innovative work complexity unfolds. Paradoxical learning clarifies how organizational agents can amplify movements in an increasingly richer world of competing demands."
11732,"Reinventing Dominance: Temporal Work in Processes of an Incumbent’s Self-Disruption -- Seminal literature has shown how disruptive technology can be a cause for the demise of established firms and pointed out that new entrants—unencumbered by history—move quickly and disrupt industries, whereas incumbents run out of time because they are pinned down by their past. We examine how history can serve as the basis for temporal work in enduring processes of self-disruption through an in-depth study of how ABB acted as a disruptor in the power transmission systems market by opening a new technology platform enabling cities’ “smart grids”. Findings from this study highlight a process that relies on the incumbent’s past providing alternative uses of history to cope with evolving tensions—which are triggered by external and internal relationships, and synchronizing imaginative sediments and changes in routines. We explicate this process of self-disruption and discuss its implications for research on enduring disruptions by technological change and innovation."
11805,"Frenemies: When Firms and Activists Collaborate -- This paper examines how contentious targeting of firms by movements influences the formation of firm-activist collaborations. I integrate research on social movements and interorganizational collaborations to argue that the symbiosis between contention and collaboration posited by existing theory, privileges firms’ incentives for collaboration and overlooks activists’ risks in collaborating with movement adversaries. I test my arguments using a 25-year panel of contentious and collaborative interactions between 118 activist organizations and 500 firms in the U.S., and network data on movements. Contrary to existing theory, I find that contentious targeting of a firm by a movement reduces the firm’s chances of collaborating with an activist in that movement. Instead, contention catalyzes collaboration only when a firm’s reputation provides assurance it will follow-through on its collaboration commitments, and when the risk of criticism from the movement is reduced. The findings support a view of firm-activist collaborations as socially-contested, highlighting a novel precursor to contention driving collaboration: cooperative ties between contentious and collaborative activists. While intuitively we may expect activists to seek to preserve social bonds by avoiding collaborations with their friends’ adversaries, it is precisely in the absence of pre-existing social bonds that activists and firms fail to transform contention into collaboration."
11815,"Problem Formulation between Organizations -- Although prior research has paid much attention to problem solving, it has overlooked a related but distinctive issue: problem formulation in the case of ill-structured and complex problems between organizations. To understand problem formulation between organizations, I used a case study design to examine the everyday problems experienced by the same client organization and main contractor in two sequential green building projects. Following the comparison of similar problems within and between projects, a core insight emerges about hasty coupling: a generalized process by which elements evoked in the description of a problem’s symptoms prompt managers to turn to specific coordination safeguards (e.g., contracts and professional roles). Through the study of hasty coupling, I generate insights into when managers take the route of formulating the actual problem versus when they seek off-the-shelf formulations. However, each route has distinct implications for the quality of problem formulation and ultimately the project’s time and cost overruns. Although the managers worked together in the first project, prior experience did not enhance problem formulation between them in the second project. The findings bring together research on problem formulation and problem solving and the interorganizational coordination literature under a generalized process of problem formulation between organizations."
11965,"Time and Punishment: How Individuals Respond to Being Sanctioned in Voluntary Organizations -- Although sanctioning is a common feature of social life, researchers hold different expectations about how members respond when sanctioned by their peers. One school of thought suggests that individuals respond to sanctions by becoming more cooperative, or prosocial, towards the group. Another line of research shows that individuals have negative emotional reactions to being punished and become less cooperative. In this study, we offer an avenue for reconciling these seemingly-conflicting viewpoints in the context of voluntary organizations, where cooperation is crucial. We build on theories of dependence and propose that individuals’ responses to sanctions shift over time as they become increasingly dependent on other members to achieve valued outcomes. We draw on unique data from microsavings groups in Colombia to develop and test this proposition, using qualitative data to flesh out the proposed mechanism and longitudinal, quantitative records to test the hypothesis. We find that individuals initially respond to being sanctioned by reducing their prosocial contributions, but that their responses become increasingly cooperative and prosocial over time. Taking social psychological concepts generated in laboratories and extending them to small groups in an economic development program, this study generates a fresh vision of sanctions as temporally- and relationally-dependent, while also revealing how processes of social control can shape inequality in voluntary organizations."
11999,"Socialized to Redistribute? CEO Social Class Background and Corporate Social Responsibility -- Understanding firm investment in CSR is one of the most discussed and contentious topics in strategy research. Yet, there is no clear imperative about investing in CSR. It is thus important to understand: what influences the extent to which CEOs redistribute firm resources to CSR? We draw on the intra-family theoretical model and theorize an inverted U-shaped relationship between CEO social class background and CSR investment. We also theorize that CEO tenure and recent firm performance moderate this effect. The results of our analyses are consistent with our theorizing. This study provides insight about drivers of CSR and contributes to research on CEO attributes by focusing on a CEO attribute—social class background—outside of the traditional focus on workplace experiences and personality."
12001,"The Cost of Forgoing Status Rewards: Major League Baseball Teams and the Free Agent Market -- Status provides organizations with privilege rewards including being able to gain discounts on resources. However, if organizations take advantage of status rewards, there is a risk of status loss based on the external perception of lower quality. The study asks if organizations will seek to take advantage of available status rewards or if the goal of status accumulation will predominate. Using a sample of Major League Baseball (MLB) free-agent contract signings, this study finds that high-status teams pay more for resources than their lower-status counterparts, regardless of the quality or status of the players. Implications for researchers address the cost of status may be ignored based on status goals, while practitioners can understand how the quest social approval may be driving up the cost of their resources."
12060,"Selective (De)coupling and Change in Clinical Outcomes -- Through an in-depth longitudinal study of hospitals’ implementation of quality improvement initiatives within a single jurisdiction, I build on previous empirical findings of heterogenous organizational responses to common institutional pressures. Yet, rather than honing the causes of this heterogeneity, I examine its relationship to desired outcomes. I use Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (Fs/QCA) to uncover intended and unintended consequences of hospitals’ heterogenous responses and theorize on why some configurations are associated with improved or worsened clinical outcomes. Findings suggest that management and healthcare scholars ought to pay greater attention to the subversive and superficial nature of some responses, as these are associated with a decline in clinical outcomes. Indeed, scholars have recognized that: “In fragmented and rationalized environments, organizations seek to respond to a greater number of external stakeholders; adapting to these external pressures can generate both internal complexity and inconsistency (Bromley & Powell, 2012, p. 20).” I find that coupling to two conflicting pressures, such as pressures to reduce costs while improving the quality of clinical services, creates internal inconsistencies which results in dynamics of subversion. In contrast, implementing clinical standards in the absence of an ambition to improve clinical services leads to the superficial implementation of these standards."
12078,"How community alignment affects bank survival: Institutional legacies and resource dependence -- Despite an increasing academic interest in the interaction between organizations and geographic communities, we know little about how firms strategically align themselves to communities, and when they benefit from such practices. Based on research on resource dependence and institutional legacies, we develop a theory on community alignment by organizations. We propose that organizations can attempt to align by adjusting key organizational elements or fulfilling the community’s social needs. The benefits of such efforts can offset the added costs, particularly at times of financial crisis, through the forging of mutual dependency which offers an informational advantage, access to community social capital and joint actions. Testing our hypotheses using data from the U.S. commercial banking industry, we find that banks with stronger organizational and social community alignment are less likely to fail, especially during economic crises. Our theory and findings contribute to research on organization and community interactions, institutional legacies, and competition between large and small corporations."
12098,"Inter-state Political Risk, Types of Political Ties and International Joint Ventures -- Inter-state political conflict is an importance source of political risks that can deter firms’ cross-border collaborations. While prior research has shown how business leaders’ political ties can help firms access information and state-controlled resources, little is known about whether and how such political ties at home country can help firms cope with inter-state political risk. We differentiate two types of political ties, business leaders’ social ties and family ties with government officials. We argue that social ties can alleviate the negative impact of inter-state political risk by helping the firms to navigate regulatory uncertainties, whereas family ties may worsen the negative impact by associating the firms with the state and tarnishing their legitimacy as viable foreign partners. We find support in the setting of Korean business groups’ entry into China through joint ventures during 1990-2005. Our study contributes to the literature on political risks and corporate political ties by differentiating ties based on the nature of the relationship and revealing their different effects in coping with inter-state political risk."
12151,"Good Fun or Laughing Stock? How CEO Trait Humor Affects Social Approval, Reputation, and Legitimacy -- We theorize how a CEO’s level of trait humor – i.e., the tendency to engage in playful social behavior that establishes incongruent relationship or meaning and, thereby, amuses followers – affects external judgements of the focal organization. Combining the social psychology of humor with research on social evaluations of firms, we argue that CEO humor has differential effects, depending on humor type (positive versus negative, and self-directed versus others-directed) and the category of social evaluations (social approval, legitimacy, and reputation). For instance, we propose that a CEO’s inclination to display affiliative humor engenders positive emotions and perceptions of social closeness and, in turn, social approval. Conversely, self-enhancing humor and aggressive humor convey more negative emotions and decrease social closeness and thus lower social approval. Moreover, as humor oftentimes violates expected norms, higher levels of non-affiliative CEO humor negatively affect perceptions of the firm’s legitimacy. Interestingly, aggressive CEO humor can foster firm reputation, as it demonstrates a CEO’s confidence in future performance and conveys self-beliefs of superior status. We also theorize that the effects of CEO humor differ, depending on the CEO’s celebrity and the type of external evaluators. Our analysis contributes to research on corporate reputation, executive personality, and leader humor."
12156,"Organizational Crises and Potential In-Group Members’ Anticipated Social Identity -- This study examines how potential employers shape potential employees’ social identity before joining the organization. Drawing on social identity theory and signaling theory, we argue that potential in-group members (potential employees) follow a routine similar to that of in-group members (employees) when assessing the value of organizational membership for their self-concepts. Our study uses organizational crises as identity-threatening events to investigate whether and how they influence potential employees’ anticipations about social identity, as well as their perceptions of the organization’s attractiveness. Empirical evidence from our scenario-based experiments with 1,617 individuals conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States shows that identity changes occurring from organizational crises decrease organizational attractiveness and that anticipated self-continuity and anticipated self-esteem mediate this relationship. The effects become stronger with increasing crisis responsibility."
12208,"Necessity is the Mother of Innovation: A Quasi-Experimental Study of Stress-Driven Innovation -- Innovative teams are typically assumed to be successful teams, but little is known about innovation in teams that face stressful conditions. Although necessary to cope with such conditions, innovation or the generation of novel and useful ideas and their implementation to create improvement, may also provoke further stress, leading to negative rather than beneficial outcomes. To study this, we conducted a simulation study of teams simultaneously working on time-critical tasks of physically manufacturing greetings cards in a competitive environment. Our manipulation of the working conditions was such that teams were likely to experience varying degrees of stress during the manufacturing process and face problems and challenges that could be solved by means of innovation. Using a multi-level path analysis on a sample of 43 teams composed of 345 participants our findings revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between severity of exposure to stressors and team innovation. In turn, team innovation was negatively associated with team performance but positively with individual team member wellbeing in terms of enthusiasm. Our study contributes to the literature on the dark side of innovation by showing how stress-driven innovation is a paradoxical phenomenon that might be both beneficial and dysfunctional."
12331,"When Advice Can Harm -- Strategic decisions can be hard, and when facing hard problems, decision-makers commonly seek others’ advice. But finding a good advisor is tricky: People are biased judges of skill, even more so in the wicked environment that typifies strategic decisions, where data can be incomplete, outcomes ambiguous, and causality foggy. Relying on empirical data, we model when and how person-to-person sharing can cause bad advice (or ideas) to spread, even without conformity pressures or malintent. We begin by reviewing how people systematically misjudge relative skill: misestimating how their own skill compares to others’. We show that if skill misjudgment is assumed away, advice taking is always beneficial. But under realistic assumptions, advice sharing benefits the low-skilled while harms highly skilled decision-makers, degrading collective skill and potentially eliminating top performers. We test an organizational design solution: When decision-makers are clustered, paying more attention to close associates, the range of practices increases. There lies a trade-off: Encouraging advice exchange homogenizes skill whereas discouraging it benefits diversity. For scholars of organizations and knowledge, we offer a novel theoretical mechanism, rooted in extensive evidence. It is distinct from prior concerns about normative conformity, and thus may be resistant to the proposed remedies. For practitioners, we sound a warning against the risks of popular practices that are meant to increase interaction and advice exchange in firms, among entrepreneurs, and in crowds."
12334,"The Other Invisible Hand: How Markets Can Propagate Valuation Errors -- Markets are ubiquitous in modern society, a status often justified by their presumed ability to aggregate bits of incomplete information from many actors into a single, unbiased estimate of value. While acknowledging markets’ unique role, we suggest that they can also be potent in spreading individual valuation errors, thus inflating collective mistakes — price bubbles. We offer a more sociological interpretation of bubbles by advancing the notion that the very ubiquity of markets can cause traders to overweight market signals in a manner that weakens the quality of individual decision-making. We examine this process empirically in laboratory studies of asset trading in experimental markets. We find that even when traders possess and comprehend the information needed to price assets accurately, they remain overly attentive to market signals (i.e., others’ pricing). Thus, they are likely to mimic other traders’ valuations — even if at odds with the asset’s true value. We further predict and find that such overattention is also sensitive to differences in levels of ambiguity, as predicted by a perspective that theorizes markets as institutionalized practices. We conclude by highlighting the relevance of our perspective, empirical approach, and supportive findings for future research on valuation errors, price bubbles, market dynamics, and micro-institutional processes."
12393,"Stigma Types and Directors’ Professional Devaluation from Firm Bankruptcy -- We examine the effects of a stigmatizing event, firm bankruptcy, on board directors’ professional future. We differentiate between directors associated with the origin of the bankruptcy and with bankruptcy filing, and ask how the stigma of incompetence (associated with bankruptcy origination) and stigma by association (or courtesy stigma; associated with bankruptcy filing) impacts directors’ professional devaluation in terms of their board appointments in the post-bankruptcy period. We also examine the impact of layered stigma, which exists when directors carry both the stigma of incompetence and courtesy stigma by being present during the origination and filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Our findings confirm that directors are treated differently by the elite labor market based on the types of stigmas they carry. Moreover, directors likely to be stigmatized as incompetent carried fewer board appointments than those with courtesy stigma or layered stigma."
12401,"Responding to expected rare events: The Civil Aviation Authority’s handling of Monarch's Collapse -- Organisational events are frequently categorised as common and expected or rare and unexpected. This polarisation ignores the existence of events which are rare and yet expected. These expected rare events may be easily definable but, for those which are clouded by uncertainty, developing specific response repertoires is prohibitively complex. Instead, organisations must rely upon generic response repertoires to manage such events, often entailing improvisation, as planning and action coalesce. I explore the link between organisational improvisation and expected rare events by studying the Civil Aviation Authority’s (CAA) handling of Monarch Airlines’ collapse into administration. Grounded in interview and archival data, my analysis reveals the CAA drew on its previous experiences of similar events to build capabilities (relational; resource; cognitive; behavioural) and devise a minimal structure. In order to successfully handle the ambiguities of the event, the organisation planned for improvisation by enabling individuals to draw upon these capabilities. My analysis subsequently reveals that adaptability and, thus, organisational resilience in the face of an expected rare event was enabled by allowing improvisation to occur."
12493,"New Perspectives on Exploration and Exploitation: When Learning Fast Is Superior to Slow Learning -- Many organizations employ algorithms that learn from their members and then shape the way these individuals learn. Nevertheless, decades of research on organizational learning suggests that imperfect learning algorithms could sustain suboptimal beliefs that trap organizations indefinitely. To study potential algorithmic learning traps, we solve the underexplored theoretical properties of the March 1991 mutual learning model and demonstrate the conditions under which individuals should trust learning algorithms' recommendations. Our results show that the received wisdom regarding the benefit of slow learning and diversity does not hold when algorithms cannot identity accurate beliefs but follow the majority. The presence of non-discerning or even manipulated algorithms suggests that individuals should learn fast instead of slow to reduce the chance that algorithms learn the wrong, misleading lessons that would otherwise diffuse and contaminate everyone. Our exploitation of the March model generates novel insights that are increasingly relevant, thus promoting the model's generalization and making its beauty more robust."
12502,"Surviving Bad Business Behavior: Network Stucture and Trust Penalty -- Sanctions against bad behavior vary greatly. Some wrongdoers are regarded as no longer trustworthy; others face only modest consequences. This study investigates how this difference can be explained. Using data on 384 people cited as being “difficult” contacts (“wrongdoers”) within networks of Chinese entrepreneurs who deemed them such (“accusers”), this study shows how social structure influences variation in the penalty in lost trust that wrongdoers pay. Controlling for personal attributes and the substance of the incident that led to the wrongdoer being deemed difficult, we find that trust in the wrongdoer decreases with network closure around the accuser. We also find that highly embedded wrongdoers “survive” the incident with smaller trust penalties. The counterintuitive conclusion is that whereas closed networks have ideal structural properties to detect and sanction malfeasance, closure around the wrongdoer protects the wrongdoer from severe consequences of bad behavior."
12616,"Playing with Trash: How Gamification Contributed to the Bottom-Up Institutionalization of Zero Waste -- The microfoundational turn in institutional theory has focused on how mechanisms of institutionalization at different levels of analysis are intertwined. However, how social actors can more specifically incentivize and motivate individuals to engage in a new practice, ultimately triggering institutionalization, remains to be studied. From individual engagement to institutionalization, trickling-up mechanisms from micro- to macrolevels of practice engagement are not fully understood. To empirically address those questions, we investigate, across eight local communities, how authorities convinced households to adopt innovative waste management practices using gamification—the application of game principles to nongaming contexts. We draw on rich longitudinal qualitative material including interviews, observation, and secondary data, to give voices to multiple stakeholders. Our empirical design includes a variety of stakeholders: from those who promote the practice, to those who engage with it. We inductively build a multilevel model explaining how gamification can lead, from the bottom up, to the institutionalization of new practices. We flesh out the role of game mechanics in pushing individuals to adopt and spread the practice through their groups and communities and become themselves advocates of the emerging institution."
12624,"Learning paradox: Antecedents and mechanisms of paradox mindset development -- As organizations face persistent, contradictory demands, the individual managerial ability to manage such paradoxes is highly relevant for organizational viability. While research in this area is generally scarce, the newly introduced construct of paradox mindset describes lasting interindividual differences in the ability to manage paradoxical tensions. We build on psychological mindset theory to formulate a socio-psychological model of paradox mindset development to clarify the antecedents of this crucial construct for the first time. Based on primary data from 199 employees of two Central European companies, we find strong support for our model: Leadership behaviors in line with our theoretical influence angles predict higher paradox mindset in followers, and this effect is fully mediated through follower`s engagement in paradoxical tasks."
12628,"He's overqualified, she's highly committed: Gender, Qualifications, and Perceptions of Commitment -- Hiring managers make inferences from signals to determine if job candidates are capable and committed to performing the job to which they are applying to work. Building on how prior research has spoken about men in terms of their firm commitment and women in terms of their career commitment, we argue additional qualifications can be helpful for women in the labor market because they help overcome initial biases about women’s reduced career commitment, but hinder men’s outcomes because they heighten concerns about their firm commitment. To test our argument, we take a multi-methods approach combining four experiments and qualitative analysis. Results showed that while overqualified men were perceived to be less committed to the firm, and as a result, less likely to be hired, these same signals boosted women’s perceived firm commitment, career commitment, and hiring outcomes (Studies 1-3a). We provide additional evidence that gendered assumptions about the agency of the job candidate may further explain these differences (Studies 3a-b). This research highlights the importance of distinguishing between perceptions of firm and career commitment and contributes to the growing body of literature on the different challenges facing men and women in the labor market."
12652,"Not On Skid Row: Stigma Reduction In Addiction Treatment Organizations -- We studied the discursive processes through which core stigmatized organizations attempt to reduce their stigma by analyzing the websites of addiction treatment organizations. While it is well accepted that organizational stigma is socially constructed, there has not been much explicit attention to how language contributes to the construction, maintenance, and deconstruction of stigma. We contribute to the nascent literature on organizational destigmatization by focusing on the process through which stigma can be deconstructed through rhetoric. Based on our discursive findings, we theorize four ways that core stigmatized organizations can reduce their stigma: (1) Reconstructing the underlying cause of stigma; (2) Emphasizing similarities with social expectations; (3) Separating from stigma; (4) Collaborating with other actors in the field. In doing so, we contribute to the ongoing discussion of the relationship between stigma and legitimacy by showing how destigmatizing and legitimating tactics were intertwined."
12681,"Corporate Financialization and Executive Interlocks -- The financialization of US corporations has been well studied over the past decade. These accounts describe the accumulation of financial assets as a ubiquitous trend that touched all corners of organization populations. What is unknown, however, is how inter-organizational relations contributed to corporate financialization. Traditional theories afforded by research on board interlocks and isomorphism would suggest that focal firms financialized similarly as their interlocks. But more recent research suggests that a focal firm’s number of executive interlocks and the financial homogeneity of its board also played important roles in its financialization. My examination of S&P 1500 firms from 1996 to 2014 yields three important findings: First, focal firms indeed tended to financialize similarly to their interlocks, but (second) the financial homogeneity of those interlocks exacerbated their effects on the financialization of the focal firm. And third, boards seats filled by a greater proportion of executive directors limited the extent of the focal firm’s financialization."
12731,"Regulatory-Disrupting but Infrastructure-Freeing: Entrepreneurial Financing During the Arab Spring -- How do revolutions affect entrepreneurial financing? Prior studies argue that revolutions generate political uncertainty that decrease financing and that a more absent state breeds greater informality. However, the Arab Spring saw an increase in state financing actually, and these state institutions, rather than their absence, directly allocated such funding to informal firms. Using a novel dataset collected as the Arab Spring was occurring in Tunisia and Egypt, our study argues that prior work has predominantly focused on how revolutions erode state regulatory power (i.e., the degree to which the state can issue rules without consulting its citizenry). However, we argue that revolutions may also free state infrastructural power (i.e., the degree to which citizenry rely on state institutions for goods and services). More specifically, we find that firms founded during the revolution paid less in bribery payments (“regulatory-disrupting”), and informal firms received more of the state funding made available amidst the Arab Spring (“infrastructure-freeing”). In paying greater attention to state infrastructural power, this study brings greater nuance to how we understand the role of revolutions on entrepreneurial activity. More generally, this study heightens engagement of work in entrepreneurship with insights from political sociology."
12792,"Trapped in a community dilemma: The consequences of normalizing private social media use at work -- While previous research in the field of social media studies has primarily focused on enterprise social media and their implications for organizations, this paper examines a neglected and so far narrowly understood phenomenon: the illicit use of private social media in the workplace and its long-term consequences. I use an affordance perspective to explain how the illicit use of private social media became normalized through three interrelated mechanisms: collective rationalizing, team socializing, and individual strategizing. The distinct temporal interplay of these mechanisms produced unintended consequences and eventually trapped organizational members in a community dilemma. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, this paper shifts the debate from enterprise social media to private social media use in the workplace. This is important because the illicit and informal nature of private social media implies different consequences for organizations than enterprise social media use. Second, the findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic interplay of affordances. As such, this study advances our knowledge how the affordances of social media can shift over time."
12800,"Exploring Temporality and Time Narratives: A case of UK Pension Funds’ Investment Strategies -- This inductive study of UK pension funds examines how pension fund trustees and their investment experts organize time and attend to the intertemporal tensions between the short- and long-term within investment strategies that are inherent to business and investment sustainability. Grounding our insights in theorization about time through narratives, we use insights from 22 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with pension fund trustees and their investment experts to highlight the significance of embedded legacy and path dependency by revealing how temporal frames of the past become embedded in the present and perpetuated into the future. We also find an intertemporal tension where pension fund trustees separate and favour short-term funding pressures at the expense of the long-term intergenerational equity. We argue that omission of the past and legacy from most strategic management continues to contribute to short-termism, which is the blight of sustainability. We conclude by drawing out some implications for policy and practice, as well as directions for further research."
12803,"The Process of Repairing Organizational Legitimacy -- This paper aims to explain the persistent legitimacy loss of a highly institutionalized organization by analyzing the process of failing legitimacy repair. Therefore, I reconstruct the prominent case of the State Office of Health and Social Affairs (LAGeSo) in Berlin, which became a symbol of authority failure during the ‘German refugee crisis’ in 2015. My findings show that whereas media triggers the organization to take action by attributing a need for change of the legitimacy object, they at the same time perceive the actual effects of these changes as an impediment of legitimacy repair. Using a paradox lens, I argue that these tensions of restructuring, cooperation and communication originate from the duality of legitimacy object and subject and are rendered salient through media’s paradoxical cognition. This contributes to our understanding of legitimacy repair in at least two ways: first, the revelation of a potential paradoxical downward spiral of legitimacy repair challenges the assumption that strategies of legitimacy repair mechanically produce desired outcomes; second, the paper contributes to the process perspective on legitimacy by revealing the fluid nature of the object of legitimacy, demanding for a more complex and dynamic lens when analyzing legitimacy processes."
12805,"Contextualizing Paradox Management: The Political Role of Coaching -- Paradox management is mostly attributed to individual abilities, such as cognitive or emotional abilities. This individual focus draws attention away from the role of context, overlooking how individuals think in relation with others and their environment. In particular, the political context of paradox management deserves more attention. Our research engages with this void by exploring how the political context of paradox management is shaped by coaching, a holding environment that potentially soothes tensions and facilitates paradox management. We conducted an inductive study of 57 semi-structured interviews with executive coaches using the critical incident technique. Our study shows that coaching shapes three different political contexts for paradox management, with distinctive holding units and holding functions. In doing so, it provides a dynamic approach to paradox management."
12819,"Towards an Untrepreneurial economy: The Entrepreneurship Industry and the Veblenian Entrepreneur -- What is driving the declining quality of innovation-driven entrepreneur-ship? In this paper, we argue the growing entrepreneurship industry is an important yet overlooked explanation. This rapidly growing industry has transformed the nature of entrepreneurship and encouraged a particular form of low-quality entrepreneurship. It has done so by leveraging the Ide-ology of Entrepreneurialism to mass-produce and mass-market products that make possible what we term Veblenian Entrepreneurship. This is en-trepreneurship pursued primarily as a form of conspicuous consumption. Aside from lowering average entrepreneurial quality, Veblenian Entrepre-neurship has a range of (short-run) positive and (medium and long-run) negative effects for both individuals and society at large. We argue that the rise of the Veblenian Entrepreneur has contributed to creating an increas-ingly Untrepreneurial Economy. That is an economy which superficially appears innovation-driven and dynamic, but is actually rife with ineffi-ciencies and unable to generate economically meaningful growth through innovation."
12851,"The Conceptual Future of Foresight: Rethinking Foresight as an Emergent Process -- Strategic foresight, as the capacity to recognize emerging environmental changes, is increasingly viewed as a distributed capability comprising multiple internal as well as external agents on different organizational levels. This recent turn towards more distributed and open approaches of strategic foresight, however, lacks a common theoretical foundation as scholars draw on different perspectives in their explanations. In light of this, the current paper conceptualizes the notion of foresight-as-emergence by drawing on and synthesizing insights from a practice lens and complexity theory. The integrative framework of foresight-as-emergence unpacks the concept of foresight space, linking the dynamics of how new insights into the future evolve from organization members’ everyday situated practices (i.e., local emergence) with the processes of how they become dispersed and adjusted throughout the organization (i.e., global emergence). In doing so, the framework provides a theoretical foundation for strategic foresight in high-velocity environments comprising both micro and macro levels."
12896,"From fringe to focal: How framing facilitates sustained increases in issue salience -- Why do some social issues remain salient over long periods while others fail to do so? We explore this question through a longitudinal qualitative study of the issue of economic inequality in discourse about capitalism. We find that an issue’s salience is impacted by the interplay of three key framing dimensions—axiological, causal, and ontological. We demonstrate how framing contests and their resolution related to these three dimensions unfold over time, and show how each provides a key link towards shaping how the issue is perceived, thereby facilitating changes in salience. Further, we show how the resolution of framing contests is informed by discursive resources in the broader cultural and political context that make some framings more resonant than others. In delineating this process, our study advances research on the dynamics of issues in organizational fields, interactional perspectives on framing, and social movements."
12935,"Does Nationalist Rhetoric Help Politicians Raise Campaign Contributions? -- Although research has paid significant attention to organizational reactions to formal political pressures, it remains to be understood how organizations react to political influence that is wielded through informal institutions. We argue that regulatory constraints on formal institutions increase political attention to informal institutions: social norms that facilitate the trading of favors. Politicians elicit informal favors from organizations through the use of nationalistic rhetoric. However, the social nature of informal institutions makes political influence more critical for firms that are strongly embedded in the local environment, yielding a distinction between the responses of domestic and foreign firms. A longitudinal state-wise examination of 476 firms in India showed that when institutional formalization encouraged political contests, there was an increase in corporate campaign contributions. This increase corresponded to politicians’ use of nationalistic rhetoric. While the rhetoric contributed to domestic firm contributions, foreign firms that were politically more engaged in the past became relatively insignificant. These findings highlight how informal institutions facilitate political influence on organizations, and in turn, how organizations inadvertently reinforce social fractures that redefine those very institutions."
12979,"Strangers at the Bedside: Subaltern Solidarities and New Form Institutionalization -- In this study, we examine how socially subordinated — or subaltern— actors may organize with dominant actors to create and institutionalize a new organizational form that addresses a complex social problem. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative study of the emergence and subsequent institutionalization of a community form for palliative care in Kerala, a southern Indian state, we delineate subaltern solidarity-making as a generative mechanism underpinning new form institutionalization. Specifically, dominant and subaltern actors constituted mutual recognition, reconfigured spatial relations, and built accountability into communities to institutionalize the new form. These relational and spatial processes of solidarity-making shift theorizing from prevailing accounts that emphasize conflict and contestation in political processes, to a generative engagement with heterogeneity in form institutionalization. We discuss contributions to research on new organizational forms addressing complex social problems and subaltern tactics in institutional processes."
13027,"From sonnets to statistics: How open scientists leverage occupational heterogeneity for change -- Occupations and their transformation have received only little attention in research on open organizing. To address this shortcoming, we advance a vernacular view on openness and use it to empirically examine how the open science community in Germany addresses a typical challenge of occupational change: occupational heterogeneity. We deepen current understandings of open organizing by theorizing the vernacular lens as a complement to the programmatic and constitutive views. It allows us to analyze openness as a practical resource for organizing rather than as a mandated principle or an imprinted value. We further theorize identity inception work as a set of activities that facilitate peer-driven change in heterogeneous occupations. Identity inception work creates a supplementary and versatile “add-on” identity that can be easily attached on top of a primary identity as specialist in a sub-discipline of academia, but in subtle ways commits its carriers to an increasing number of open practices."
13031,"Responsible Leadership: An Emergentist Perspective -- We studied the situated nature of the emergence of responsible leadership. Drawing on an emergentist perspective (Elder-Vass, 2005, 2008; Lawson, 2012), our analysis of observational and interview data in three organizations shows how responsible leadership emerges as participants’ ‘shared concerns’, which are embedded in existing relations that give meaning to what is responsible and possible. In contrast to previous research, we show how relationality, in addition to individual moral duty, shape the emergence of responsible leadership. Our qualitative study shows how practical forms of responsible leadership emerge from four distinct types of shared and nested concerns of the study participants. We contribute to the theory on the emergence of responsible leadership by unpacking how the socio- relational context shapes leadership responsibility."
13180,"Becoming an Institutional Entrepreneur: How Identity Shapes Change Agents' Ability and Motivation -- Institutional entrepreneurs are actors who play a leading role in establishing or changing institutions. They gather support for a vision of change when ambiguous field characteristics are prevalent, such as during institutional contradictions. Existing research conceptualizes institutional entrepreneurs as heroes who appear from nowhere to change the world, and sheds little light on the formative factors in their identity. Therefore, I applied a phenomenological methodology to study the experiences of select institutional entrepreneurs and compared these with that of actors who did not act as institutional entrepreneurs in similar situations. I found that institutional entrepreneurs had developed an identity with certain values as a reaction to crucial experiences during their first socialization. In line with their values, they had embraced various institutional contradictions throughout their lives and thus developed skills that enabled them to initiate institutional entrepreneurship. Additionally, their early established identities influenced their motivation to respond to prevalent institutional contradictions by realizing their key values during opportunities for change. The findings reveal that institutional entrepreneurs are disembedded actors only when seen from the outside: from their own perspective, they legitimize their behavior vis-à-vis their past experiences. This insight contributes to the debate on the paradox of embedded agency."
13233,"Contested Ideological Imprinting: State, Family Reading, and Entrepreneurship in Post-Mao China -- We theorize the contested process of ideological imprinting. We argue that ideological imprinting tends to be both hierarchical and sequential, and whether organizational imprinters can effectively buffer against the penetration of societal imprinters depends on the temporal order of the latter. Empirically, we study how family books reading at adolescence buffers the pre-Mao cohort and Mao cohort against the communist ideological imprinting during the Mao China (1949-1978), and subsequently shapes their entry into private entrepreneurship in the post-1978 reform era. We find that family reading atmosphere at adolescence was more effective in mitigating the negative effect of the communist state ideology on the pre-Mao cohort’s than the Mao cohort’s post-1978 entrepreneurial entry. Our study shows that incongruent alternative values of individuals—once successfully imprinted—mitigate the effect of a dominant societal ideology, generating heterogeneous effects on organizational behavior. Implications for research on imprinting analysis, values and entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurship in post-communist societies are outlined."
13257,"Digital Curation as a Catalyst for Open Organizing: Brokering Meaning, Relationships, and Emotion -- While a rich body of scholarship illuminates the inherent conflict and paradoxes of open organizing and open strategy processes, how low-power actors might advance open organizing to exert control over their organization’s strategic decisions remains a black box. In this paper, I present findings from an inductive study of 40,000 social media posts and comments from the Save Market Basket Facebook page to develop a theory of digital curation—how actors leverage their brokerage role to select and interpret digital material (e.g., digital videos, online news reports, others’ social media contribution, emails, etc.) to shape meaning, relationships, and emotion among disconnected parties. My paper 1) contributes to scholarship on open organizing and brokering by illuminating how digital curation of meaning, relationships, and emotion enables low-power individuals to advance open organizing and exert control over strategic decisions affecting their organizations; 2) illuminates how contests over meaning and control in open organizing are navigated through digital curation; and 3) provides insight to the role of emotion in both the brokerage and open organizing literatures."
13330,"Serendipity and Framing in the emergence of a platform for responsible innovation -- Why would an academic research project turn into a platform for responsible innovation despite incentives to focus on publishing research papers? To address this puzzle, we draw on the case of Patient Innovation, a non-profit medical platform, focusing on innovations by patients and caretakers to find affordable solutions for rare and chronic diseases by creating a ‘knowledge commons’. Initially set up as a ‘research platform’ aimed at generating scientific publications, it turned into a ‘help-society platform’ to create a wider social impact, despite not initially targeting such a goal. Using a framing lens, we explore the role of moral emotions and serendipitous inspiration in the creation of this medical platform. We examine how the reframing towards socially responsible innovation occurred despite strong institutional pressure to focus on publishing scientific research. In doing so, we develop a model illustrating how interactional framing in situations lead actors to shift towards responsible innovation. We explain how actors frame and reframe situations in which they interact and transcend their immediate self-interests in order to serve collective interests."
13360,"From taking to shaping – Why temporal tensions matter for organizations -- In this paper, we advance the notion of temporal tensions by building on three time-related constructs that address how individuals perceive and think about time: temporal depth, temporal focus, and urgency. Our focus lies on how actors shape and embrace temporal tensions on multiple levels within and outside the organization. Embracing such temporal tensions enables actors to understand the nestedness of conflicting goals, change temporal structures, and to focus their attention on urgent issues in the organization and in the social, ecological, and economic environment. We inform research on time in organizations by advancing the notion of temporal tensions and by emphasizing their multi- and cross-level nature. We contribute to research on tensions and paradoxes in organizations by conceptualizing tensions as the result of different stimuli and of an actor’s cognition. Lastly, we also contribute to research on temporality by bridging the subjective and objective notion of time in temporal tensions."
13391,"Orchestrating Interstitial Networks: Dynamics of High-potential, Low-expectation Collaboration -- Network orchestrators try to mobilize value for and from networks by recruiting network members and purposefully shaping their interactions to foster collaborative outcomes. While the activities of such actors have been assessed in dynamic settings in which network members participate on a full-time basis, orchestrators may find themselves in networks where members are engaged as a low-commitment side activity, which, nevertheless, might turn out to be highly important for them. We introduce the concept of interstitial networks to denote such settings and explore how orchestrators in these networks perform their role. We find specific dilemmas orchestrators face in these settings, as well as three orchestrating practices for navigating them: 1) probing themes and partners, 2) adapting orchestration timelines and activities, and 3) experimenting with interaction formats. Our findings highlight the mutually reinforcing relationship between orchestrating practices and the manifestation of interstitial elements in networks. Moreover, we show the experimental and collective character of orchestrating interstitial networks."
13497,"Knowing Your Place: Place-claiming, -reimagining, and Institutional Change -- Drawing from the theories of institutional work and place, we investigate how community organisations react to the loss of place meaning during incremental institutional change. Situating our inquiry in 41 community organisations in the United Kingdom that formerly were financially supported by a central organisation but now are expected to generate their own income, this novel context enabled us to investigate how community organisations seek to invoke and preserve tangible and intangible dimensions of place at the same time as diversifying place-based activities. We introduce the construct of place-claiming to explain how community organisations imbue place with prior physical, cultural, personal, and sensory attachments; and reimagining place to describe the influence of place-claiming on place change. Since reimagining place is layered onto place-claiming, our analysis also comments on institutional layering."
13526,"Truly Trustworthy or Simply Strategic? An Examination of Strategic Generosity in the Trust Game -- The importance of trust and reciprocity in facilitating mutually beneficial exchange has long been recognized. However, research suggests that the development of trust and reciprocity may be challenging if the actions are considered to be strategically rather than intrinsically motivated. This paper investigates whether initial acts of generosity impact the emergence of trust and reciprocity across strategic and non-strategic settings. Results suggest that when generosity can be perceived as being strategic it induces less trust. As a result, our research suggests that strategic considerations can have a detrimental effect on welfare: earnings within equivalent trust games are lower in the strategic than in the non-strategic condition. Importantly, the observed generosity does not appear to have been strategic. Rather, it appears that simply the perception of strategic motivation is enough to reduce subsequent trust. On the other hand, we also observe that those subjects who acted more selfishly display significantly more reciprocity in the non-strategic relative to the strategic setting. This behavior appears consistent with moral balancing."
13546,"“Category Thickness”: Descriptive and Evaluative Ambiguities as Determinants of Strategic Category -- Research in market categories and in social evaluations underline that market actors use categories as strategic tools and that strategic categorization implies a certain degree of categorical ambiguity. While research on categories have mostly focused on the ambiguity regarding the category’s meaning, or the “descriptive ambiguity”, an overlooked dimension explaining strategic categorization is the ambiguity regarding the category’s valence, or the “evaluative ambiguity”. In philosophy, the categories that mix descriptive and evaluative ambiguities are called “thick”, as opposed to “thin” that are either purely descriptive or purely evaluative. This conceptual paper studies how the combination of descriptive and evaluative ambiguities explains producers’ strategic category affiliation. In doing so, it offers contributions in research on market categories and social evaluations."
13625,"Two Faces of Cultural Products: A Behavioral Understanding of Artistic and Commercial Success -- How organizations, including project-based organizations (PBOs), pursue multiple goals is a central theme in research on the behavioral theory of decision making. We develop two competing approaches, balanced and imbalanced, to understand the responses of PBOs. The balanced approach suggests that PBOs may simultaneously achieve multiple performance goals, whereas the imbalanced approach contends that organizations can only focus on one goal at the expense of the other. We then identify a series of boundary conditions, including individual factors (i.e., leadership capacity) and organizational factors (i.e., interorganizational collaboration and resources), which may help organizations balance multiple goals. We examined our theory in the context of the Chinese film industry, where artistic acclaim and commercial success are both important performance goals. We found negative relationships between artistic acclaim and commercial success of films, supporting the imbalanced approach. Our three boundary conditions under which PBOs may pursue the balanced approach are also largely supported. Our study contributes to the behavioral theory of decision making and provides important implications for managers."
13640,"Firms of Endearment: Organizational Imprinting in Business Ecosystems -- Business ecosystems have been advanced as an analytical lens for studying multilateral arrangements of firms that span industries and in which the boundaries between competition and collaboration are unclear. A key construct in the ecosystem literature is the complementor. These are firms that, while not formally connected to a focal firm, provide services that are necessary for the focal firm’s value to be realized by consumers. While the literature has emphasized the tensions faced by a focal firm as it attempts to align the efforts of its complementors to its value proposition, however, these studies have tended to take a static view of this phenomenon: they haven’t considered how a focal firm’s past decisions of which complementor firms to engage impact their ability to engage with successive complementors in the future. Moreover, the literature on ecosystems has viewed complementors as fungible. As a result, we still lack an understanding of how a focal firm’s choices of complementors over time impact the evolution of an ecosystem. This paper contributes to the ecosystems literature by building theory that foregrounds the role of complementors in the development of business ecosystems and by responding to calls for an inter-temporal perspective on ecosystem evolution."
13675,"Paradox Intensification: Navigating coopetition in industry-wide alliance formation -- Organizations increasingly collaborate with competitors to advance technology, build industry ecosystems and address grand challenges. However, the tensions between cooperation and competition foster ongoing challenges that thwart the success of these important initiatives. We offer new insights to unpack the nature and management of coopetition challenges by applying paradox theory to rich data from the formation of a cooperative alliance addressing industry threats by environmental activists in one of the most competitive industries, the Alberta oil sands. Our in-depth analysis of the formation of this industry alliance over three years reveals a model of paradox intensification. Whereas scholars have described how challenges of navigating such paradoxical tensions diminish over time, we find the opposite. As the collaboration grew in scale and in specificity, the tensions between collaborating and competing grew in quantity and challenge. We find that in addition to requiring formal structures, effectively addressing such intensifying paradoxical tensions required informal interactions by individuals, who we describe as champions, who built the alliance through fostering personal relationships and trust. This model of paradoxical intensification advances the growing literature on the paradoxes of coopetition by unpacking the challenges and responses to navigating the tensions between cooperation and competition over time."
13760,"How Constituents Evaluate Configurations of Status and Conformity -- Recent management research on institutional pluralism has surfaced that today’s organizations typically face multiple – oftentimes competing - institutional expectations. Despite this recognition, research on institutional pluralism remains circumscribed in two important ways: First, the existing literature typically assumes that pluralistic organizations straddle two sets of competing expectations, rarely more. Second, competing expectations are represented and evaluated by discrete sets of constituents with unidimensional expectations, for example when investors only evaluate financial aspects, and environmentalists only environmental aspects of firms. Examples that challenge these two assumptions abound, for instance when impact investors evaluate firms holistically based on their financial, environmental, and social performance. Where individual constituents have those multidimensional expectations, we argue, they holistically evaluate how organizations conform with multiple, interdependent expectations. Yet, such configurational approaches to evaluating pluralist organizations are currently absent from the literature. To address this gap, we conducted a fuzzy-set configurational analysis of 117 international business schools to uncover the configurations through which prospective students evaluate how MBA programmes conform with their expectations. Based on our analysis, we make three contributions to the literature on institutional pluralism. First, we explain how organizations are evaluated holistically as configurations of multiple interdependent, rather than independent expectations represented by individual constituents. Second, by doing so we add to current accounts of institutional outcomes. We extend current, binary accounts of the existence or demise of pluralist organizations to consider social evaluations as a more nuanced outcome of pluralism. Third, we provide new insights about how configurations of conformity and status interact in producing holistic evaluations in the context of institutional pluralism."
13776,"Nexus Theory as a New Perspective of the Management Norm -- It was recently argued that an ethically-complete normative theory of the firm requires a vision of a “nexus of imperfect duty” that complements the contractual vision of Coase, i.e. the latter being a nexus of perfect duty. It is shown here that this complete normative vision provides the foundation for an insightful explanation of the evolutionary development of the management team. This evolution is founded on an extension of the “unity theory” of virtue ethics as applied to the management team in the form of a “balanced development” theory. The impetus for this managerial team evolution is the maintenance of a type of balance in the nexus of dispositions towards imperfect duty (or virtues) as the unity theory suggests for the virtues of individuals. Methods for reinforcing this balanced evolution are also reviewed here. This nexus of imperfect duty approach poses an ethical norm for management that offers a fresh vision for managerial theory and analysis. It organizes insights into the interrelatedness of management functions, and the development of the managerial team. In this imperfect duty context, firm development is shown to be built upon efforts that “go beyond” expectations of management creativity."
13840,"When Institutional Factors Matter Most: Cross-National Variation in Disaster Risk Reduction Planning -- In this study, we show that institutional influences are stronger than technical ones in predicting the cross-national diffusion of standards on disaster preparedness. We examine the adoption of the first global disaster risk reduction standard, the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), in 186 countries from 2005-2015. Although practical accounts emphasize the technical benefits of the framework in mitigating potential harm and damage, surprisingly, these explanations do little to explain country-level adoption – even when a nation has recently experienced a disaster. Thus, we test and find strong support for an alternative explanation, which draws on the influence of organizational sociology: that institutional influences are the primary driver diffusion of global standards. Specifically, the enduring effects of historical legacies play a particularly important role in adoption. Taken together, our results suggest that preparedness against natural disasters is a culturally mediated practice. A practical implication of our work is that many of the countries most in need of disaster preparedness may, at present, be the least prepared."
13885,"A Contingency Model of The Effectiveness of Impression Management Tactics -- This paper proposes a contingency model showing the effectiveness of two types of impression management tactics when implemented in market categories with differing degrees of categorical stigma. Specifically, we investigate ego centric tactics (those that center on member specific information) and alter centric tactics (those that use information about others), and explore the mechanisms – related to the risk of perceived manipulation – that determine their effectiveness under environments characterized by different levels of stigma. Using a large dataset covering the US food retail industry between 2006 and 2015, we find that ego centric tactics are more effective when implemented in categories that exhibit low rather than high levels of stigma. Conversely, we find that alter centric tactics are more effective in highly stigmatized categories, as opposed to categories displaying low levels of stigma. Our study highlights the strategic role of impression management in aiding category members to instrumentally position themselves in the competitive space and contributes to the research debates on impression management in contested settings and stigma management strategies."
13888,"Falling down or bouncing back:a two-stage, dual-path organizational learning process after failure -- Research demonstrates that experiences of failure can have positive and negative effects on a firm’s subsequent behavior and performance. This contradictory finding necessitates in-depth exploration on the mechanisms behind failure-related performance change. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by disaggregating the postfailure learning process into “falling down” and “bouncing back” paths and addressing their relative effects on organizational performance in an integrated framework. We test our arguments in the context of a computer-based strategic business simulation. We repeatedly collect survey data from 144 teams in an executive education program during 2016-2018. Our study contributes to the literature on organizational learning from failure in three dimensions. First, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating macro and micro perspectives. Specifically, we advance our understanding of a firm’s subsequent reactions to failure through its micro-foundation rooted in top management team (TMT) dynamics. Second, our findings indicate that organizational learning from failure involves two stages, namely chaos stage and reassembly stages. Finally, we reveal that the severity of failure amplifies both falling down and bouncing back effects on organizational performance change. From our findings, we draw implications for organizations to facilitate effective learning from failure."
13895,"A New Look at Occupational Learning and Socialization in Contemporary Careers -- As the traditional employment relationship has deteriorated in the U.S. and in much of the world, the nature of careers has been changing. Workers today need to continually navigate an external labor market, construct their careers out of a series of jobs or short-term gigs, and take responsibility for training and retraining themselves to remain employable over time. Despite the burgeoning literature examining workers’ efforts at navigating the new economy, we know relatively little about how workers attempt to reskill themselves in the course of their careers. This paper utilizes a unique setting—coding bootcamps—to examine how workers attempt to enter a skilled occupation without traditional organizations serving as the backdrop for their efforts. I argue that bootcamps resembled learning collectives where learning from peers and near-peers figured more prominently than expert instruction. Under conditions of minimal expert instruction and obstacles to legitimate peripheral participation, I show how aspiring software developers sought out an occupational community in virtual spaces, learned asynchronously from unknown others, developed their practice through mock-work among themselves and managed to get hired into junior developer roles."
13971,"Organizational response to shortfalls: The role of decision makers’ self-confidence and time slack -- The behavioral theory of the firm (BTOF) states that performance shortfalls trigger organizational responses seeking to restore performance above the aspiration level. However, previous research has shown weak support for this proposition. One explanation for this lack of support is optimistic performance assessments: Performance shortfalls might not be perceived as problematic by decision makers, which leads them to underestimate the need for a response. In this paper, I argue that decision makers’ self-confidence promotes optimistic interpretations of performance assessments when performance is ambiguous enough. However, when performance shortfalls are unambiguous, I predict that decision makers’ self-confidence leads to the opposite consequence, strong organizational responses, due to risk-seeking behavior. In addition, in this paper I propose that organizational slack is a source of ambiguity in performance assessments allowing for favorable interpretations. Particularly, I propose that decision makers prone to make optimistic performance assessments overestimate the value they can extract from slack, which leads them to underestimate the need for a response to performance shortfalls. I find support for my hypotheses by analyzing 101,146 first down decisions from the National Football League (NFL) between seasons 2009 and 2016."
13989,"Evaluator Status and its Effect on Gender Bias in Evaluations -- There is consistent evidence that women are disadvantaged in evaluations, with women receiving worse evaluations than similar men. However, there has been less discussion and evidence regarding the mechanisms that attenuate or exacerbate this bias. We draw on status theory to discuss whether evaluators who gain status will exhibit less gender bias in their evaluations. Specifically, we argue that status attainment has a disciplining effect thus reducing observed gender bias in evaluations. We use the presence of close-to-random allocation of servers to customers in the restaurant industry and evaluations on the digital platform Yelp to test this theory. In aggregate, we find a systemic gender bias in restaurant reviews: When evaluators report having a female (versus male) server they rate the restaurant significantly lower than its average rating to date, however, this gap is reduced by more than half after an evaluator gains status."
14016,"Entrepreneurial Clustering and the Development of Positive Psychological Capital -- In this paper, I explore the core idea that geographical clustering may provide entrepreneurs with psychological benefits - a type of benefit that is not yet recognized in the literature on clusters. Specifically, I develop a theoretical model along with testable propositions where I argue that entrepreneurial clusters have the potential to develop into ‘communities’ which provide clustered entrepreneurs with varying degrees of psychological sense of community. A strong psychological sense of community in turn helps entrepreneurs develop positive psychological capital through processes of social comparison, social influence, perceived social support, increased participation inside the cluster community, and emotional sustenance. Higher levels of positive psychological capital helps entrepreneurs deal with the psychological pressures associated with starting and managing a small business and thereby leads to improved venture performance, albeit up to a threshold level of psychological capital after which higher levels of psychological capital may hurt venture performance. Contributions to the literatures on clusters, entrepreneurship, and psychological capital are discussed."
14062,"The Perception and Evaluation of Founder Experience by Hiring Firms: A Field Experiment -- Founding one’s own venture is often seen as desirable; however, most entrepreneurs must subsequently enter wage employment. Although a transition to wage employment is common, it remains unclear how founder experience is perceived and evaluated by recruiters at hiring firms. We argue that current theory can be used to make a strong case for founder experience as an asset as well as a liability to hiring firms. We first discuss the advantages and disadvantages of founder experience for wage employment and then test these theories through a field experiment, namely a resume audit study. Specifically, we test how those who started their career as founders fare relative to those who started their career as wage employees at the initial evaluation stage of the hiring process: receiving a callback for an interview. We find that former founders receive fewer callbacks than non-founders; however, all founders are not disadvantaged similarly. Former founders of successful ventures receive even fewer callbacks than former founders of failed ventures. Through 20 interviews with technical recruiters we highlight the mechanisms driving this founder experience discount: concerns related to the applicant's capability and ability to fit into and remain committed to the wage employment and the hiring firm. We also investigate three sources of heterogeneity: applicant gender, hiring firm age, and job location."
14177,"Can I Survive or Will I Survive: Mechanisms Linking Network Structures of Managers & Store Survival -- In the existing survival literature, a fundamental and important question is why some firms survive but others fail. By integrating a motivation-ability perspective and social network theory, we develop a novel model to examine the process mechanisms of the job satisfaction and creativity of store managers in linking relationships between their network advantages, namely, centrality and brokerage, and store survival. Our findings suggest that the centrality of store managers exerts a positive effect on their job satisfaction; brokerage, their creativity. The job satisfaction and creativity of store managers are important mediators. Job satisfaction mediates the relationship between the centrality of store managers and store survival, and creativity mediates that between the brokerage of store managers and store survival. Our study provides meaningful theoretical contributions and managerial implications."
14381,"Mind and Matter: The Coevolution of Technology and Institutional Logic in Field Transformation -- Research examining field level transformation is generally fragmented into literature either focusing on patterns of change in the socio-cognitive evolution of institutional logic or in the materiality of technological innovations. We seek to bridge these growing, but largely independent streams of inquiry by developing a co-evolutionary model where logic construction and technological innovation interact to escalate or constrain field level transformation. We first synthesize institutional logic and technological transition literatures into a compatible framework with complementary stages across de-institutionalization and re-institutionalization. Drawing on several historical examples, we then build propositions to explain how socio-cognitive and technological change pathways interact with each other enable or constrain field transformation. Our co-evolutionary theory of field transformation bridges disparate literatures examining a common phenomenon and advances understanding of factors driving the pace and scope of field transformation."
14399,"The Exchange, Formalization, and Implementation of Meaning in Sensemaking Conflicts -- This paper draws on previous sensemaking and sensegiving research in an attempt to explain how repeated situations of competing understandings around issues could lead to a catastrophic outcome. We provide insights to this question by drawing on qualitative data from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. We analyze four critical events (i.e., sensemaking conflicts) that took place during the months leading up to the disaster. These events have in common that 1) multiple understandings existed as to how the event should be dealt with; and, 2) action was required to overcome the event and proceed with the operations. Our findings suggest that these sensemaking conflicts were solved through a three-stage sensegiving process consisting of meaning exchange, meaning formalization, and meaning implementation, where organizational systems and procedures were used as devices to strengthen the effectiveness of sensegiving. We also suggest that access to such devices varied between organizational members, thereby creating a disadvantage for some of the members to successfully transmit their understanding to others. We propose that the recurrence of these sensemaking conflicts and their interconnectedness led the decision-makers to vastly underestimate the riskiness of the situation, thereby contributing to the occurrence of the disaster."
14464,"Temporal Distinction of Multiple Goals and Effects on Strategic Risk-Taking -- Organizational goals play a central role in driving firm decision making. The behavioral theory of the firm conceptualizes goals as situational aspirations that guide organizational adaptation through performance feedback. However, this aspiration-directed logic implicitly assumes the short-term orientation of decision makers, while the effect of long-term strategic goals on firm decision making is less explored. Our study focuses on long-term strategic goals, which, we argue, influence firm decision making through decision makers’ commitment. Borrowing insights from strategic communication research, we conceptualize strategy specificity to capture decision makers’ commitment to strategic goals and theorize its implications for firm strategic risk-taking. Additionally, we examine the interactive effects of strategy specificity and performance feedback on strategic risk-taking, with contingencies of managerial discretion and board shareholding. Using panel data on 1,074 Chinese listed firms in manufacturing industries, we find that firms with higher strategy specificity engage in more strategic risk-taking. However, this behavioral tendency is weakened when firms receive strong negative or positive performance feedback. Moreover, we find that the moderating effect of performance feedback on strategy specificity is enhanced by managerial discretion but mitigated by board shareholding."
14558,"Public Enemies: Reputation, Celebrity, and Scandalizing Organizational Misconduct -- Considering that scandals result from the disruptive publicity of transgressions, we examine how social evaluations such as reputation and celebrity influence why some transgressions are publicized and not others. Extending current knowledge about the effects of social evaluations on publicity, we argue that while reputation and celebrity burden firms by directing media attention to their transgressions, the sociocognitive content of these evaluations further provides nuances into how different transgressions are scandalized differently. Because of audiences’ tendencies towards rational and deliberate information processing when evaluating high-reputation firms, reputation attracts significant publicity to a transgression due to the transgression’s high relevance to firms’ value creation potentials. In contrast, while celebrity also attracts publicity due to its emotion-laden sociocognitive content calling for the media’s attention to the emotionally devastating nature of transgressions, it also interferes with the media’s processing of transgression characteristics (e.g., severity and recency) as to amplify the impact of the characteristics when they fit the emotional frame of celebrity, and attenuate when not, on the media’s publicizing decision. We tested our arguments in the context of data breaches involving publicly traded U.S. companies."
14562,"A theory of non-hierarchical organizational growth -- We propose a theory that explains when an organization can grow in size without increasing the extent of managerial hierarchy. We formulate a computational model in which the number of layers of managers required for a given number of producers depends critically on how production is organized. However, the distinctive feature of our approach is that we conceptually separate the organization design of production activities from the shape of the managerial hierarchy. The central insight is that, the localization of conflicts between teams is an effective approach to keeping managerial hierarchies flat than modularizing work within teams or creating non-hierarchical teams per-se. Our model also offers insights about how the initial decisions of division of labor that founders make impact the scalability of managerial hierarchy."
14575,"Attention Disorders and Attention Mismanagement in Organizations -- Advancing the attention-based view (ABV) of the firm, we examine the four attention disorders (ADs) in organizations: cognitive myopia, cognitive hyperopia, cognitive astigmatism, and cognitive presbyopia and their effect on attention mismanagement: focal, situational and structural. We also investigate ADs’ temporal, spatial, effectual and directional dimensions. Finally, we propose how organizations could combat ADs and their harmful effects."
14586,"Organizational Event Stigma: Typology, Processes, Stickiness -- What do events such as scandals, industrial accidents, activist threats, and mass shootings have in common? They can all potentially stigmatize the organization involved. Despite the prevalence of these stigma-causing events, management research has provided little conceptual work to characterize the nature and dimensions of organizational event stigma. This article takes the perspective of the audience to unpack the audience evaluation process that is triggered by these events, identify critical dimensions for categorizing types of event stigma, and explore the role of the stigmatizers, the stigmatized, and the bystanders in producing what we call “sticky stigmas.” We postulate that volitional and collateral event stigma are likely to lead to stigma stickiness. Our conceptual framework clarifies the antecedents and consequences of the different types of event stigma, highlights the importance of emotional evaluation, and opens avenues for further research into the role of diverse audiences in the stigmatization process."
14638,"You Jump, I Jump: A Bundle-based Perspective of Category Membership -- Extant studies in category research has increasingly focused on the horizontal structure of the category system and incorporated the interconnectedness between categories into their analyses. However, we know relatively little on different types of connections a category can build with other categories and to what extent different types of connections will affect a category’s usage in products. We argue that categories bundle together and form different clusters. We refer to a group of aggregated categories as “category bundle” in this paper. We argue that market participants (i.e., producers, audiences, and market intermediaries) are aware of category bundles, and they utilize the bundle-based approach in their evaluation of products. In this sense, not only the overall position of a category in the category system, but also a category’s fitness in the category bundle, affects its chances of appearing in the description of a product. We find support for the bundle-based perspective in our empirical analysis of feature films produced in Canada and the U.S. Our study enriches the understanding of the structure of category system and its impacts on the product market. We also provide a novel explanation on why category spanning remains ubiquitous although existing studies propose that category-straddling products are prone to be punished harshly."
14639,"Organizational redesign, knowledge transfer, and the formation of new boundary-spanning ties -- In this study we examine the interplay between change in formal structure and informal social networks within organizations. Drawing on social capital and social exchange theories, we derive hypotheses about how interaction between cohesion and diversity in personal advice networks that organizational participants maintain before an organizational redesign affects their propensity to form boundary-spanning ties after it. We test our hypotheses using new data that we have collected within a large healthcare organization that has recently experienced a major organizational redesign and change. The results indicate that both cohesion and diversity of personal advice networks significantly affect the propensity of organizational participants to access knowledge across boundaries after a change in internal organizational structures and processes. In line with our hypotheses, the results also suggest that cohesion and diversity have opposite effects on the propensity of organizational participants to access knowledge across boundaries after the change depending on their dominant network role (sender or recipient) in the network of informal advice relations before the change. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on organizational change, knowledge transfer, and intra-organizational networks."
14643,"The Persistent Specialist Advantage: Typecasting Dynamics in Feature Films -- Whether to be a specialist or generalist is a long-standing question for job candidates. The extant literature argues that the excess returns to labor market specialization exists, and the returns will decrease as job market candidates climb the career ladder. Should the aforementioned argument be valid, a job candidate with a long tenure will avoid being specialized. This argument, nevertheless, is contradictory to an observation in the feature film labor market that the ratio of specialists is stable among job candidates across different career stages. We argue that considering the effects of external audiences on hiring decisions can help reconcile the classic argument with the observation. Specifically, we argue that specialist advantage may sustain among the specialists whose skills and ability are highly matched with their image among audiences. We use rich longitudinal data from 1990 to 2015 on the careers of 21,914 actors and actresses in English-speaking films to test our hypotheses. We find that the moderating effects of actors’ tenure on specialist advantage is contingent on their public image among audiences. For actors whose skills and public image are highly matched, a long tenure will not decrease, but enlarge their specialist advantage. Our research contributes to the labor market identity research by presenting hiring decisions as dual-matching processes in which both the hiring firms and external audiences are involved."
14649,"Organizing the Wisdom of Crowds: How Wikipedia Helps to Theorize and Legitimize the Blockchain -- Many new community-based organizations rely on the assumption that platform technology can aggregate judgements of their members into results which are better than individual judgements. This “wisdom of crowds” effect is typically explained by stochastic effects which erase individual psychological biases. We deviate from this psychic-stochastic explanation by highlighting the relevance of organizing and technology: When applying a sociological institutionalism perspective on knowledge production, it becomes clear that institutionalized processes like typification, abstraction, legitimation, and objectification are mechanisms of organizing everyday knowledge in communities that go beyond stochastic effects. When distinguishing technological layers of platforms, the relevance of organizing principles for specialization, variation, and generalization becomes visible. How everyday knowledge production and technological layers are intertwined is demonstrated by analyzing Wikipedia in general and the development of “Blockchain” on Wikipedia in particular. We reconstruct how a dynamic semantic network of legitimizing and de-legitimizing concepts evolves around Blockchain. There we observe how Bitcoin, which is surrounded by stigmatizing concepts, is generalized to Blockchain, which is free of stigma and becomes embedded into various knowledge domains. The empirical example demonstrates that platforms which support theorization processes can aggregate individual judgements to “wiser” results. With this research, we deepen the understanding of relational theorizing by highlighting the importance of legitimation and stigmatization within institutional analysis. Additionally, we revive the application of institutional analyses in the domain of technology studies."
14673,"Two Faces of Mental Representation And the Adaptive Implication of Their Joint Development -- Extant studies on the impact of mental representation on firms’ adaptation tend to emphasize either sensing or responding role of mental representation. The difference in the perspectives on mental representation gives rise to the puzzling effects of pursuing a representation that recognizes a wide range of factors and their interactions on the firm’s adaptiveness. This study addresses the puzzle by demonstrating the joint development of sensing and responding representations and articulating its adaptive implications. I employ a neural network model of a firm’s mental representation that consists of the sensing layer that reduces a given situation to decision factors and the responding layer that formulates the firm’s response to the decision factors. The results suggest a temporal trade-off of cultivating a complex sensing layer. Firms pursuing multiple objectives cultivate a complex sensing layer, which promotes their adaptation in the short run. However, in the long run, the complex sensing layer impedes the firms from formulating a proper rule to respond to the observed situation. This study extends our understanding of the role of mental representation in firms’ adaptation. Also, this study sheds light on the interdependence among firm objectives, which emerges and resides in firms’ cognition."
14788,"Value Co-Creation and Distribution: A Contingency View on the Effects of Financial Slack -- This study develops a theoretical perspective on inclusive processes of value co-creation and distribution contingent on the financial slack in the organizational system. By focusing on the economic and institutional costs of slack, as well as on its benefits to support economic exchanges with social dimensions, we propose an inverted U-shaped relationship between slack and the co-created value. We preview our argument by analyzing how slack sustained a collective decision-making process to plan a new national railway, albeit the dubitable social gains of the solutions achieved by consensus. We then draw on organization governance literature using new institutional economics to theorize empirical observables, and probe the slack-value relationship with a game theoretic model that holds constant the essence of the governance arrangement. We show the value-slack relationship is moderated by the accrual of benefits from a negotiated settlement: if the benefits are low, the co-created value is maximized by increasing slack up to the point that maximizes the capital provider’s share of value. If the benefits are high, the co-created value is maximized by increasing slack even more so as to maximize the enfranchised stakeholders’ share of value. We also show that, up to a point, increased slack widens the space of mutually acceptable solutions. Also, the effect of slack is steeper if the costs of slack can be reduced by making credible commitments today to mobilize more resources tomorrow."
14822,"Why so few? The gender representation gap in academic STEM fields, a system dynamics approach -- We use a simulation approach to study what factors influence the under-representation of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). In particular, we focus on understanding why, despite the increased representation of women in graduate programs and assistant professorship positions, we still observe a small proportion of women in tenured positions. To do so, we build a dynamic feedback model of women representation. According to the model, the gender representation gap – i.e., the lack of women in tenured professorship positions - is driven by gender bias and women’s perceptions of the workplace. We show that the behavior of this model is consistent with previous studies focusing on persistent gender gaps in knowledge-based organizations. Finally, we explore the behavior of the model under different experimental conditions."
14841,"The Doctor Will See You Elsewhere: Enterprise IS and the Changing Control of Firm Activities -- In this work, we examine how the adoption of enterprise information systems affects the ability of high agency organizational actors to control the activities performed by firms, including both what those activities are and where they are done. While extant research highlights the ability of managers to more carefully manipulate the activities performed by the firm when enterprise IT is adopted, work has yet to examine whether high agency subordinates will use such technology to appropriate rents. Empirically, we investigate whether surgeons reallocate patients to ambulatory care settings for treatment after the adoption of electronic health records (EHR). Findings suggest that while the adoption of basic EHR technology has limited effect, the adoption of advanced EHRs dramatically increases the number of patients treated in an ambulatory care setting. Interestingly, these relationships are strongly moderated by both the financial incentives of the physician and the profit motives of the hospital. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed within."
14865,"Communities of Practice as Bridges between Institutional Entrepreneurs and Frontline Practitioners -- This paper seeks to understand how new practices that challenge established norms and values become institutionalized by studying the development of corporate philanthropy in France over three decades (1979-2011). Our inductive qualitative study uncovers the processes that enable actors at both field and organizational levels to enhance a new practice’s internal and external legitimacy, ultimately leading to its institutionalization. In particular, we identify the central role of a community of practice as a bridge between the field-level, purposive interventions (theorizing, influencing policy) of an institutional entrepreneur and the organizational level, emergent interventions (mobilizing, embedding) of frontline practitioners experimenting with the new divergent practice, thereby enabling its legitimation and, ultimately, its institutionalization. As such, our findings contribute to refine our understanding of institutionalization processes as inherently distributed and to uncover communities of practice as the missing link between “heroic” entrepreneurs’ interventions and the hidden work of frontline practitioners implementing the new practice."
14868,"Org. Legitimation in a Polarized Media Landscape: The Role of Robust Org. Impression Management -- We conducted a longitudinal case study about the United States (U.S.) electronic vehicle manufacturer Tesla and its spokesperson Elon Musk to investigate how organizations can maintain organizational legitimacy through organizational impression management among a heterogeneous audience, as exemplified by the ideologically polarized U.S. media landscape. We uncovered that Tesla’s spokesperson, Elon Musk, mobilized two different types of what we refer to as ‘robust organizational impression management’ (i.e., chameleon and diplomacy strategies). The ‘chameleon strategy’ portrays Tesla as ideologically open and appeals to different, highly polarized audience demands, while the ‘diplomacy stratgy’ places Tesla in a diplomatic role that serves to de-polarize how the audience views the organization. Together, these strategies enabled Musk to both retain Tesla’s good relations with the leftwing media and to simultaneously reduce its illegitimacy among the rightwing media outlets. In this way, Tesla maintained its legitimacy among a highly heterogeneous audience. Our study contributes to the literatures on organizational legitimation, organizational impression management, robust action, and political ideology."
14916,"Network Structure, Actor Attributes, and Intraorganizational Knowledge Sharing -- How do the relational and structural characteristics of interpersonal networks affect knowledge sharing within organizations? And how are these effects, in turn, influenced by the personal attributes of the individual network members? To answer these questions, we focus on intraorganizational inventor networks and investigate how tie strength and structural holes influence two major dimensions of knowledge sharing, i.e., knowledge absorption and knowledge transfer. Then we consider the moderating effect of a crucial attribute of inventors, i.e., their status of star inventors. Drawing on patent data from 33 of the largest firms operating in the pharmaceutical industry worldwide during a 34-year time period, we show that both the average tie strength and the proportion of structural holes which characterize inventor networks exert an inverted U-shaped effect on both intraorganizational knowledge absorption and transfer by inventors, and that these four curves become flatten in the case of star inventors, when compared to inventors in general."
14920,"Sexy Work Not Sex Work: How Dirty Work Gets Clean -- Research on stigma is often divided between areas focusing on organizational stigma and job-based stigma, also known as dirty work. The dirty work literature has made strides in outlining the various ways in which dirty workers cope with stigma, but, unlike the organization stigma literature, has not elaborated de-stigmatization strategies. Drawing on interviews with 33 women working in the burlesque and stripping segments of the exotic dance industry, we explore how dirty work can get clean. Our findings reveal the ways in which the stigma of dirty work is not only attached to the work and workers, as existing literature suggests, but to the organizations it takes place in, and the associated audiences and scripts linked to these organizations. We show that by shifting out of stigmatized organizations, finding new audiences, and developing new scripts, actors without resources or power can shed the stigma of their work. Our findings thus enable us to link the dirty work literature to organizational stigma literature by pointing out the important ways in which they are related, and how dirty workers can clean their work without changing the primary elements of it."
15001,"How organizational change emerges from everyday work. The role of temporal nexus -- We address the puzzle of why some events of everyday activity in organizations generate organizational change, whereas others do not. Our study of ship design and construction company contributes to the understanding of how certain events of activity have a temporal orientation that enables them to be generative of organizational change. When comparing the temporal orientations of activities at different events we found that change was generated when the event (1) formed synergetic nexus between past and future activities; (2) combined a long temporal reach into past activities with immediate future application of ideas, which enabled actors to (3) project future activities that differed markedly from on-going activity. We develop the concept of “temporal nexus events” to explain how organizational change emerges through connecting dynamics at such events. We then extend our contribution further by showing how everyday activity at other events becomes vital support for the change process. We develop a model to explain how the two types of events of everyday activity interact in change processes."
15067,"Enduring Effects of Nationalistic Ideology on Strategy Formation Process: The Case of Nippon Gakki -- The enduring effect of the intense ideological experience of key organizational actors—top executives—on their subsequent strategic decisions is explored through a longitudinal archival case study of Nippon Gakki Ltd. (present-day Yamaha Corporation), a Japanese musical instrument manufacturer that pursued the motorcycle industry in the 1950s. An intense nationalistic ideology during WWII imprinted future top executives of Nippon Gakki, who, in the Post-WWII era, sought to expand their businesses driven by their imperative to pursue national prosperity and prestige. The ideology influenced three dimensions—organizational identity, organizational memory, and values—affecting managerial cognition and facilitated breaking out of their prior strategic frame to enable Nippon Gakki to explore a wide variety of strategic options unfettered by its extant product classes, industry affiliations, and technological competency. These findings invite further studies of the effects of political ideology on managerial cognition, their organizational mechanisms, and the managerial use of nationalistic ideologies."
15072,"Follow Him or Her? CEO Gender and Inter-organizational Imitation of Strategic Investments -- Research suggests that organizations within an industry tend to imitate each other’s actions to alleviate uncertainty around strategic investments, and, in this process, focal firms are likelier to imitate some referent firms rather than others based on the social structural attributes of the referent firm. We extend this prior research to argue that the imitability of referent firms’ strategic actions will also be determined by the gender of the CEOs leading those firms. Based on significant domains in gender research, we formulate competing predictions about the role of CEO gender in driving inter-organizational imitation: gender serves as either a discounting or distinctiveness-based cue. We further posit focal CEO’s political ideology – on the conservatism-liberalism continuum – as the reconciliatory boundary condition for resolving these two competing predictions. We test these ideas using a large, longitudinal sample of S&P 1500 firms during 1994-2017. Our findings provide generalized support for the discounting-based mechanism in focal firms’ imitation of referent firms’ advertising and R&D investments, suggesting that, all else equal, male CEOs’ actions are imitated at higher rates, but also indicate that liberal-leaning focal CEOs may tend toward distinctiveness-cue, imitating female CEO-led firms at higher rates than their conservative-leaning counterparts."
15096,"Founder Cognitions and New Venture Outcomes -- How do entrepreneurs’ cognitions shape their ventures? While research has established that founders’ backgrounds and prior experiences shape their firms and firm outcomes with long-lasting consequences, these studies have largely taken for granted the underlying founder cognitions that transfer individual-level variation to the firm level. Little is known about how entrepreneurs think, and how their cognitions affect firm-level outcomes such as revenue. To uncover entrepreneurial cognition, this study uses a mixed methods approach. Using applications submitted online by entrepreneurs seeking funding from a large, nonprofit foundation, an inductive grounded theory analysis reveals two diverging cognitions – an “exchange construal” and an “organization construal” – that reflect differences in how entrepreneurs think about themselves and their ventures. These findings are then scaled across 139,806 applications, using a supervised machine learning method, to test whether and how these construals influence firm-level outcomes. The results indicate that entrepreneurs’ construals are significantly associated with differences in firm revenue. These findings suggest that entrepreneurial cognition is imprinted into the firm and impacts firm outcomes, illuminating a contributing factor to heterogeneity in new venture outcomes."
15228,"Identity Consistency as a Signal of Resource Autonomy in Acquisitions -- Drawing on market signaling theory, this paper examines whether the market positively reacts to acquisitions when firms express a consistent organizational identity. We theorize that identity consistency signals a firm’s autonomy in utilizing resources to pursue economic profits. Such a market signal reduces investor perceived uncertainty in management activities and boosts market confidence in the capitalization of acquired resources. The signaling effect is also found to be stronger under a positive earnings surprise and a stable industry environment."
15293,"Tertius Dominans and the Persistence of Structural Holes among K-Pop Songwriters -- This paper explores how inequality between successful artists—who can access to a wealth of opportunities—and unsuccessful artists—who face daunting challenges even to survive in their career—provides unique insight into the persistence of structural holes in collaboration networks. The author proposes that when two unsuccessful artists who never collaborated before share a tertius dominans, that is, a common collaborator who is more successful, the unsuccessful artists are less likely to initiate a new collaboration that excludes the tertius dominans. This allows structural holes of the successful artists to persist. Studying the careers and collaboration network of K-Pop (Korean popular music) songwriters, the author argues that daunting career challenges make unsuccessful artists yield brokerage opportunities to their successful collaborator who can bring them better career prospects. Using several empirical designs, including case-control design, songwriter fixed effects, and difference-in-differences, the author estimates the hazard of exclusive closure, where the disconnected collaborators initiate a new collaboration without the broker, and finds supporting evidence. Implications to studies on the instability of structural holes, inequality and networks, and the careers of cultural production are discussed."
15332,"Breaking Out Without Selling Out -- Based on a theoretical framework that addresses the “motive inference problem,” I identify when and why expansion may be interpreted as betrayal by original customers and when original customers may accept and even welcome expansion. In particular, insofar as the available market size in the original market segment seems too small for survival and sustaining services valued by original customers, expansion to new segments will appear justified as a way to serve original customers. By contrast, when the available market size in the original market segment seems sufficiently large, expansion will raise suspicion of betrayal. This theory is tested in two studies. Study 1 shows that expansion of a microbrewery beyond its home state is associated with lower online ratings from home-state reviewers when the available market size in the home state is large but the same action is associated with higher ratings when the home state’s available market size is small. Study 2, an online experiment on a simulated consumer goods startup, shows that the key driver of the effect is the consumer’s perception of how expansion undermines or augments a startup’s perceived commitment to its original customers."
16379,"Unpacking Stigmatization: Labeling, Audience Heterogeneity, and Market-Based Sanctioning -- Existing research on organizational stigma has predominantly focused on its origins, as well as for the consequences of stigma for the organizations that are subjected to it. By contrast, the stigmatization process has remained relatively unexplored from an empirical standpoint. In this paper, therefore, we theorize about the stigmatization process and we suggest that its effectiveness in eliciting market-based sanctions will be a function of: 1) the labels used in framing stigmatizing judgments; 2) the audiences using those labels; 3) the “fit” between vilifying labels and the audiences using them. Through an analysis of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) in the wake of stigmatizing judgments formulated by various audiences and targeting firms active in the defense industry between 1998 and 2016, we find broad support for our arguments."
16385,"Anchored Differentiation: The Role of Temporal Distance in the Comparison and Evaluation of New Pro -- A new design can be compared with its contemporaries or older designs. In this study, we argue that the temporal distance between the new design and its comparison play an important role in understanding how a new design’s similarity with other designs contributes to its market valuation. Construing the value of designs as a combination of their informational value and their expressive value, we propose the anchored differentiation hypothesis. Specifically, we argue that the market audience weighs the expressive value (which enhances with how much the new design appears different from others) more than the informational value (which enhances with how much the new design appears similar to others) when the comparison is made to contemporary designs. However, the market weighs informational value more than expressive value when the comparison is made against designs from the past. From a data set that combines US design patents and stock market reactions in the days subsequent to such a patent being granted, we explore how a new design’s degree of similarity vis-à-vis contemporaries or predecessors affect its market value. We find that the market value for a new design decreases with its similarities to contemporary new designs (contemporary differentiation) but increases with its similarities to prior designs (past anchoring). Furthermore, we find that the value of contemporary differentiation is enhanced with increased product visibility, whereas the value of past anchoring is enhanced with increased product technological lifespan. Hence, we contribute to the growing literature on optimal distinctiveness and design innovation by offering a dynamic perspective that helps resolve the tension between similarities and differences in evaluating new designs."
16413,"Feedback in creative processes: Toward a communicative action perspective -- Research on creativity highlights the role of feedback as a contextual factor that fosters creative performance. However, it advances a rather mechanistic understanding of communication that obscures the specific practices in feedback interactions and their constitutive power in shaping creative performance. In this paper, we develop a framework that conceptualizes how organizational actors interact in communicative feedback processes on creative ideas. By drawing on the theory of communicative action by Jürgen Habermas and Hans Joas’ theory of creative action, we make the case for a more complex and nuanced understanding of organizational creativity as constituted in communication processes. In doing so, we highlight the important but underresearched role of recipients when confronted with creative ideas by delineating the communicative struggles that these actors face in this process. We extend the literature on creativity by introducing a theory of communicative action as a suitable lens to better understand communication processes through which creativity does or does not come into being."
16416,"Organizational Resilience: A model and Future Research Agenda -- In the face of challenging conditions, resilience capabilities are essential for organizational survival and sustainability. Despite significant academic interest and practical utility of this construct, a lack of theoretical foundation, definitional inconsistencies, and an apparent operational muddle predominates. Extant reviews of this topic comprise an amalgam of frameworks, conceptualizations, and empirical findings from disparate perspectives such as supply chain, strategic, and operational management. Frames of reference from an organizational level are rare. We extend past reviews by deconstructing management-related definitions and measures of organizational resilience through a series of in-depth and broad-based text mining exercises using Leximancer. We found five distinctive research streams, suggesting that organizational resilience is comprised of cognitive, behavioral, and micro-foundational components. We conclude with a unifying definition that can bring coherence and clarity for future research. The central role of contextual contingencies such as the environmental conditions, time, and timing is highlighted."
16420,"Broadening Vision Around Values: An Integrative Two-Factor Theory of Workplace Value Congruence -- Value congruence is an important determinant of human behavior in organizations. It influences positive states for workers (e.g., a sense of belonging, job satisfaction, and positive affect) and is beneficial for organizational work practices (e.g., commitment, citizenship behaviors, and tenure). Conversely, value incongruence leads to negative states (e.g., out-groups, organizational exit, and depressive symptoms). To date, values have been conceptualized context-free (e.g., human or personal values) or disaggregatedly in the work environment (e.g., work values, political values, leadership values, and cultural values) and value congruence has been viewed almost exclusively as a positive construct. Based on the underlying theories of variation theory, salient value similarity hypothesis, self-categorization theory, and signaling theory, and adopting the ‘similarity leads to attraction’ and ‘dissimilarity leads to repulsion’ hypotheses, we develop an integrative two-factor theory of value congruence. This model integrates work, political, cultural, and leadership values, and conceptualizes the impact of congruency and incongruency as two separate psychological processes. We conclude with a discussion of directions for future research."
16442,"Exploring Routine Interdependence: Fluid Boundaries and Adaptive Patterning -- This paper advances theorizing on routine interdependencies and related methodological challenges. We aim to challenge the implicit assumption within cluster or ecology-based conceptualizations of routine interdependence that routines are clearly distinguishable pro-cesses interrelated via interfaces and/or people. Building on an ethnographic longitudinal case study of routine change within a manufacturing firm, we develop a framework that explains routine interdependence beyond clusters or ecologies. Thereby we contribute to routine inter-dependence research in three ways: First, routine boundaries are blurry and dynamically shift-ing rendering it difficult to identify them ex-ante and ex-post. Second, as a result the coordination of routine interdependence occurs between dynamically, reciprocally interrelated action steps rather than at the interface between routines. Third, these insights raise important methodological questions of granularity, which have significant implications for our interpretation and study of routine stability and/or change. Stability and/or change thus become a matter of different levels of analysis which need to be taken into account when comparing routine inter-relations as either clusters or ecologies."
16449,"Granularity Matters! Towards a Methodological Framework for Routine Studies -- This paper introduces the concept of granularity into routine dynamics studies. To establish levels of granularity we develop a phenomenological perspective on action, the central category of routine dynamics studies. By conducting an extensive literature review we show that routine dynamics scholars have at least unconsciously applied diverging levels of granularity in their empirical studies. We argue that side-stepping questions of explicitly addressing granularity significantly impedes the comparability of studies since different levels of granularity bring different aspects of performing and patterning processes into focus. Following this, we develop a methodological framework that allows scholars to establish and report on the level of granularity in their study. Finally, we sketch out some implications of taking granularity seriously for writing up research on routine dynamics."
16469,"Managerial Interpretations of Performance Feedback -- Organizational performance feedback theory, derived from the Behavioral Theory of the Firm, is one of the most utilized theories to explain strategic behavior of organizations. This theory argues that when performance relative to aspiration levels decreases, problemistic search increases. However, empirical evidence is not as unequivocal. We propose that one way to resolve the contradicting empirical evidence is to identify and study in-depth factors that explain the coalescence between the process of performance-aspiration comparison and managers’ interpretations of performance feedback. In this conceptual paper, we extend the performance assessment component of performance feedback theory. We do so by arguing for a more refined and elaborated behavioral model of responses to performance feedback, based not only on whether performance surpasses the aspiration level or not, but also accounting for managers’ assessment of reliability and for their level of satisfaction. To facilitate future research on responsiveness to performance feedback we provide testable propositions."
16497,"Cross-pollinating in the beehive: embracing hybridity at a social entrepreneurship coworking space -- How does participating in a coworking space enable entrepreneurs to embrace plural institutional logics and engage in “hybrid venturing”? To explore this question, our research draws on a longitudinal study of a French coworking space gathering entrepreneurs who seek to reconcile social and commercial logics in the context of a socially entrepreneurial project. As social entrepreneurs generally lack pre-established patterns specific to this “hybrid” venturing mode, we show that the interactions at the coworking space help them embrace hybridity through (1) identifying with a community of peer, like-minded entrepreneurs; (2) collectively learning about and experimenting with this venturing mode, through their own projects but also through the coworking space as a hybrid venture in itself; and (3) connecting with and contributing to building the emerging ecosystem around hybrid venturing. The perception of the coworking experience, however, varies depending on the previous background of the entrepreneurs and in particular their familiarity with each of the logics at play. These findings contribute to the literatures on hybrid venturing and organizing, coworking spaces, and social entrepreneurship."
16529,"Reframing Sequences And Revising Spaces -- We study how corporate innovators develop their frames over time to legitimize their innovations for internal and external audiences. Existing literature has focused on either internally or externally legitimizing innovations but not on how these processes interact. This interaction is important, however, as innovators often depend on diverse audiences simultaneously. By following four corporate ventures at a healthcare incumbent firm, we find that the initial frame and the sequence of frames determine whether internal and external legitimacy is gained and maintained over time. We found that it was particularly effective to initially emphasize novelty by framing an innovation as distinctive, because that created the most space for revising frames in the future. Familiarity frames, instead, constrained innovators because they inhibited innovators’ space to reframe their innovations and address emerging legitimacy threats. This illuminates that framing to gain and maintain internal and external legitimacy depended not only on innovators’ initial frames but also on the subsequent sequence of frames over time. For corporate innovators this indicates that they mostly benefit from emphasizing the novelty of their innovations as this enables them to address emerging legitimacy crises over time and maintain the legitimacy they previously acquired. We discuss implications for literature on framing and legitimacy."
16540,"Making the Impossible Possible: Paradoxical Processes of Reconstructing a Grand Challenge -- Advancing the promise of paradox theory to address large-scale complex social problems, or grand challenges, necessitates focus on paradox at the interorganizational level. We contribute to this by developing an empirically-grounded framework explaining how distributed organizational actors work through multiple paradoxes to address a grand challenge. We draw on a global qualitative study of a grand challenge: how to improve the speed of low and middle-income countries’ financial response in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters. We focus specifically on initiatives that bring together government, market and development actors to ensure rapid capital flows for immediate disaster response. Three paradoxes permeate our grand challenge: whole-part; long-short; and developmental-financial. By focusing on critical incidents, we show how: (a) distributed actors work through paradoxes by situated focusing: foregrounding one pole in order to achieve the other; (b) paradoxical poles are entangled in a process of situated knotting; (c) localized actions arising from situated focusing and situated knotting contribute to an expanding repertoire of possible actions for addressing the grand challenge globally. We advance paradox theorizing on paradox salience, multiplicity, and the dynamics of shaping paradox equilibrium. We also further understanding of how grand challenges evolve within the fragmented interests of distributed actors."
16573,"The role of translation in the formation of a field: the case of a startup ecosystem -- How does the process of translation shape the formation of a field? While previous studies focused on the influence of top-down forces shaping the process of translation, few studies highlighted how translation processes shape the formation of institutions. By studying the emergence of a startup ecosystem, a manifestation of an institutional field; this paper theorizes the micro-processes and dynamics of field formation. We pay particular heed to, and advance the process of translation as the formation of a field is marked by a lack of stability, clearly defined roles and rules. This paper extends the translation literature, by elaborating on different types of ‘translation work’ and how these shift as the field forms and develops. Lastly, this paper contributes a better understanding of the roles of carriers in the translation processes, an area that is understudied to date."
16574,"Orchestrating for Performative Resource and Capability Configurations -- Value-adding orchestrations of resources and capabilities are at the heart of Penrose’s resource-base-view (RBV). However, while the management literature unanimously agrees on the importance of such resources and capabilities orchestrations for performance at the level of the firm, little research has investigated how performative firms, those firms leading their respective industries, orchestrate their resources and capabilities. This paper has two significant contributions: Theoretically, it takes a performative lens to the RBV and thereby focuses on specifically on the resource-capability orchestrations of firms with performative outputs. Empirically, the paper is one of the first to apply a configurational methodology to identify these performative resource-capability orchestrations by investigating 124 performative Danish manufacturing firms and their investments and deployments of innovative technology resources and human-centred capabilities. The paper finds that there are differences in the orchestration of resources and capabilities based on the innovativeness of the firm’s outputs. Performative firms make heavy investments into and deployment of technologies, but only the configurations of the most performative firms additionally include investments into and deployments of specific human-centred capabilities. Important implications emerge in relation to what performativity theory can add to the original RBV and how a configurational methodology can operationalize this theory."
16853,"The Interplay between Institutional and Individual Determinants of Organizational Transparency -- This paper develops organizational transparency theory by exploring the determinants of transparency. A typology-based model explores the interplay between the institutional and the individual determinants of organizational transparency. The typology explains the mechanisms and outcomes of different combinations of the determinants of transparency, which lead to four archetypes of transparency: Complete transparency, Symbolic transparency, Illusionary transparency, and Residual transparency. This multilevel approach provides a new perspective, which helps to interpret the conflicting results of past studies of the determinants of transparency. It reveals the conditions under which the unintended consequences of transparency initiatives—such as information decoupling or the transparency paradox—may occur. The practical implications of ways of making organizations more transparent are considered with a view to avoiding the negative consequences of transparency initiatives."
16920,"The (relative) effects of typicality on volatility: A study using word embeddings -- Studies on typical firms – firms which are aligned with the prototype of their industry – have focused on whether typicality leads to superior or inferior valuations by audiences. They largely ignore the impact that typicality may have on the stability of audiences’ valuations over time. This paper proposes that typical firms experience lower volatility in stock prices as investors can make meaningful inferences based on the information encoded in industry prototypes to value them. This effect is weaker in ambiguous industry categories, as the information encoded in prototypes is of lower quality. I test these hypotheses in the setting of publicly listed firms in the U.S. I measure typicality using a new method that relies on word embeddings and a corpus of over 80,000 annual reports to represent firms in a shared semantic space. Results largely support the proposed hypotheses. This has implications for the literature on market categories, for the literature on organizational approaches to financial markets, and for computational approaches to organizational phenomena."
16932,"Broadening our Sight of Leadership Relationships. Moving from Dyads to Triads. -- In studying social relations, going from dyads to triads has the greatest impact on relational dynamics than any other change in group size. Yet triads are an underutilized unit of analysis in the appraisal of leadership relationships. This paper proposes that triads are a leadership configuration on their own right, which magnifies three leadership relational dynamics otherwise under-emphasized in dyads, groups or networks. These triadic leadership phenomena are: the role co-enactment (where the same person is concurrently a leader and a follower); the mediation of leadership (where one individual brokers leadership across triad constituents); and the skip-level relationships (where two constituents can form coalitions cutting through reporting lines). By utilizing main triadic theories and research this paper analyses these phenomena and their relevance for organizations, proposing four theoretical types of triads, along the assumptions of formality (vertical vs horizontal), and symmetry of relationships (between leader and follower). The contribution to leadership theory is multiple because the triadic phenomena and the triads typology broaden our understanding of leadership away from heroic views onto more pragmatic and context-dependent ones. This paper offers practical insights of leadership as an adaptive activity, where the roles of leader and follower are interconnected, and effectiveness is centered on the capacity to shift roles according to the flow of influence."
16942,"Business models as artefacts driving temporal segmentation and logic consolidation -- We investigated coexistence of alternative business logics by studying business model differences as manifestations of the underlying logic. We build on institutional complexity by studying the ways in which existing and entering actors rationalize the external and internal drivers of change and turn these into business models. Our results show the close connection between business model and the underlying logic that confines the available business model options for institutionalized actors. The study contributes to the institutional logic theory by illustrating the institutional foundation of a business model, identifying key characteristics of competing business logics, and suggests novel mechanisms of temporal segmentation and logic consolidation for managing the co-existence of the alternative logics."
16964,"Lone Geniuses Or Collaborative Pairs? Formal Role Separation to Enhance Organizational Creativity -- Drawing from the literature on formal roles and organizational creativity, we tested whether formal role separation between creative and business functions at the top of organizations enhances their creativity and under which conditions such separation has a significant impact. While the “role as resource” approach sees in functional separation a way to combine diverse claims and access various forms of capital, we investigate its link with the generation of novel and useful outcomes. In the setting of high-end fashion houses, we found that when two distinct individuals filled the formal roles of creative director and CEO, organizational creativity was significantly higher. Organizational creativity is especially enhanced in cases of formal role separation when the creative director works on multiple projects because this improves specialization and gives more freedom to creative directors to experiment with novelty. Besides, companies, whose creative director and CEO started working for them at the same time, show superior creativity results. We found no evidence that formal role separation is beneficial for the focal firm’s creativity when its creative director works for multiple companies. Our findings suggest that when companies face multiple goals, like creative organizations, having a clear formal role configuration is beneficial to organizational creativity."
16986,"Saying hello and waving goodbye: intra-organizational tie formation when brokers leave -- Brokers, who serve as indirect ties between others, can play an important role in the formation of new collaborative relationships. Yet we know little about how the mobility of such individuals changes the role that they play. In this paper, I explore the how the organizational exit of individuals in brokerage positions influences tie formation between previously unconnected workers. Whereas these exiting individuals may be expected to play a lesser role in the formation of new collaborative relationships, I argue that they may in fact play a greater role as their exit will both stimulate demand for such helpful brokering among the workers they will leave behind and alter the costs of this type of brokering. I explore the impact of brokers on tie formation using data on employees engaged in scientific research within a single organization. Using journal article co-authorship to identify collaborative ties, I find support for my argument. Furthermore, I show how the role of exiting brokers varies depending upon the nature of their exit, tie strength, and the relative status of the brokers. In so doing, this paper illuminates how new tie formation is shaped by the mobility of brokers, extending our understanding of the dynamics of collaborative networks within organizational settings, brokerage, and the effects of employee mobility."
17044,"Ecological perspective on organizational resilience: Ethnography of Korean Buddhist temple -- Organization scholars tend to conceptualize the notion of resilience as recovery capacity. The concept is often operationalized by return time, i.e., a measure of how quickly an organization bounces back to an initial state from an external shock. Such conceptualization and operationalization reflect an engineering perspective on resilience. This tendency, however, omits a much richer framework for understanding resilience—an ecological perspective that focuses more on adaptive capacity of organizational system. Drawing upon ecological perspective, we aim to unpack internal mechanisms that shed more light on the adaptive aspects of resilience. We conducted three-month ethnography in one of the most revered Buddhist temples in Korea. Korean Buddhist temples are situated to adapt to rapidly changing socio-economic environment in Korea over the last decades, yet they also hope to protect historical tradition against change. Our real-time participant observation and inductive analysis show how a Korean Buddhist temple has maintained its core historical identity while adapting to changing environment. We theorize two contradicting elements of the mechanism ‘pushing’ and ‘pulling’ that enable an organization to simultaneously balance change and tradition in the midst of environmental change."
17112,"The Effect of Sustainability Manager’s Field Engagement on Organizational Adoption of Sustainability -- Social activists are often successful in their disputes with target organizations, as is evident from the concessions targeted organizations often make. However, concessions do not necessarily result in substantive changes. This is because over a longer period of time, activists are not fully capable of monitoring and maintaining direct pressure on targets or continuing to generate negative publicity. This paper contributes to research at the intersection of movements and organizations by investigating if, and if so, how individuals that are formally tasked with instituting movement-aligned changes, termed “insider allies,” achieve subsequent and substantive changes in their organization. Using data on U.S. higher education organizations, we examine the effect of field-level engagement from sustainability managers—the insider allies, in our case—on adopting a voluntary sustainability reporting tool which is an indicator of change beyond initial commitments. The results of a longitudinal quantitative analysis of 622 schools demonstrate that the more sustainability managers have participated in field interactions, the greater the likelihood that their school adopts the voluntary reporting tool. Our findings indicate that engagement in field-level interactions with a range of actors around central issues that are pertinent to the movement enables insider allies to mobilize resources and craft identities as change agents that enable them to drive substantive change within their organizations."
17152,"Queens of Drag: A Multidimensional Perspective on Core Stigma -- This paper critically assesses RuPaul’s Drag Race as a stigmatized organization which has built its success on the active spectacularization of its core stigma, through the showcasing of specific organizational discourses and transgressions. Drag Race is an interesting case as the organization does not conceal stigma; on the contrary, it leverages the transgressions associated with the social deviance of drag queens, enhancing success and acceptance with wider audiences over time. We focus on how audiences generate discourses that trigger this acceptance and how the organization fuels these discourses, using them as strategic resources for organizational performance. We adopt a performativity perspective to analyze discourses generated by the audiences and by the organization itself, primarily focusing on online discourses. We contribute to a better understanding of how organizations can leverage the factors that lead to their stigmatization and make them acceptable for different audiences."
17154,"Identity work orientation: unpacking divergent identity construction processes of police newcomers -- Through a longitudinal ethnographic study of new recruits into an English police service we explain how different ‘identity work orientations’ (i.e. legitimacy, authenticity and competence seeking) direct different patterns of identity work and produce different work identities within the same socialization processes. In so doing, we make a three-fold contribution. First, departing from mainstream research of newcomers’ identity construction, our study highlights the fragmentation and diversity of externally provided work identities and the important influences of newcomers’ own orientations in their identity formation. Second, by illustrating three distinct identity work processes, we challenge the monolithic portrait of identity work and theoretical disconnection in the identity work literature. Third, we offer identity work orientation as an analytical lens that transcends theoretical boundaries and sensitizes researchers to diverse identity work. Key words: Identity construction, identity work, newcomer socialization, police."
17166,"Risky Business: Status and Costs in the Market for Audit Services -- A large body of research in sociology and management presumes that lower costs are one of the most significant advantages that high-status firms enjoy. Although prior research provides some support for this argument, the evidence is limited and largely indirect. In order to better understand the relationship between a firm’s status and the costs it incurs, we analyze fees paid by clients in the $60 billion U.S. market for audit services. Contrary to the predictions of existing theory, we find that high-status firms tend to pay more than their peers, even after controlling for the complexity and riskiness of the audit. Our analyses suggest that the most likely explanation centers around the role of status in attracting disproportionate attention; auditors seem to charge their high-status firms more in anticipation of the increased attention that they suspect such firms will garner in cases of misconduct."
17179,"Converging Tides Lift All Boats -- This paper investigates the consequences of an understudied yet prevalent phenomenon in emerging technology fields: consensus/disagreement among experts on the proper criteria to use in evaluating firms’ technologies. While previous studies show that the emergence of evaluation criteria for a technology improves the life chances of well-performing firms in the new sector, we theorize that consensus in evaluation criteria increases investments to all firms and found supportive evidence from an experiment with 80 Chinese investors (Study 1). We further argue and found, in a second experiment with 412 U.S. participants (Study 2), that evaluation criteria consensus increases investments because it induces investors to view all firms in the new sector as technologically competent and to predict positive evaluations from others. Analyses of archival data on investment in U.S. (Study 3a) and Chinese firms (Study 3b) in artificial intelligence technology fields also lend support to our arguments. By exploring the social-cognitive processes that link technology evaluation criteria consensus to investments in emerging technology fields, this paper advances scholarly understanding of the micro-foundations of the institutionalization processes in new market sectors."
17197,"Enhancing Linguistic Inclusiveness in Organizations: A Russophone Bank in Post-Soviet Kazakhstan -- With the growing demand for linguistic inclusiveness in society – a condition where different languages are respected – organizations often face pressure from stakeholders (e.g., governments, customers) to incorporate multiple languages into their operations. Nevertheless, organizations often pursue linguistic homogenization (e.g., using a single dominant language) to achieve greater efficiency or to enter the global market, excluding other languages from their core activities. Reflecting this phenomenon, organizational scholars largely focus on the selective use of languages and its exclusionary effects on intra-organizational dynamics. As a result, little is known on how organizations can embrace low-status languages and enhance linguistic inclusiveness over time. Our qualitative study of a Russophone bank in Kazakhstan shows how monolingual employees gradually changed their linguistic practices in a context where incorporating a low-status language (Kazakh) into business operations was a very low priority for the organization. We found that a small group of language workers, initially hired to help the organization maintain monolingual practices, could behave outside the boundaries of what they are originally hired to do, and sparked changes in the organization’s linguistic dynamics. Our analysis shows the ways in which language workers demanded respect and contributed to the creation of a linguistically more inclusive environment. By theorizing a process through which previously marginalized languages can gain recognition and become part of everyday organizational practices, we provide important insights on multilingualism and linguistic inclusiveness in organizations."
17295,"The evolutionary paths of competence and integrity trust violation processes -- We explore trust violation as a diagnostic process. Based on the in-depth analysis of four cases, we present trust violation diagnosis as a path-dependent process in which the initial labeling of a transgression (competence-based or integrity-based) has an important bearing on the process. Understanding this process forms the basis for suggestions of how early interventions could prevent the breakdown of trust."
17349,"Direct versus Indirect Vendor Channels and the Scaling of Worker Voice Around Digital Technologies -- In this longitudinal, qualitative study, I follow the use of a digital production monitoring system in a manufacturing firm to study mechanisms for worker voice in the context of digital, networked technologies. As a complement to studies that situate mechanisms for worker voice in the relationship between workers and employers, I draw four conclusions regarding worker voice around these new technologies sometimes referred to as “Industry 4.0.” First, worker voice can meaningfully occur long after the initial design and deployment phases of new technologies. Second, the effectiveness of worker voice may depend on the type of channel that exists between workers and third-party vendors. In particular, direct versus indirect vendor channels for worker voice can shape the practices by which workers draw attention to problems between the technology and the workflow, speak for the benefit of a key user, and pose technology solutions. Third, when workers have direct vendor channels, they can more effectively use voice practices to achieve worker-centric technological capabilities—improvements that expand the control of workers, including reducing surveillance and increasing worker access to data. Finally, new worker-centric technological capabilities can be quickly and broadly distributed by the vendor across the field of firms using the technology."
17398,"Work-Life Postures for Organizations: Organizational Structural and Cultural Responses to Employees -- We propose an organizational perspective for work-life balance (WLB) policies and work-personal conflict (WPC) accommodations derived from the macro, organizational and job environments. To explain our theoretical model, we draw from institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983) and signaling theory (Spence, 1974; Spence, 1973) and recognize job demands to explicate drivers for the implementation of WLB polices and WPC accommodations. Conceptually we differentiate between work-life balance and work-personal conflict and clarify the meaning of these constructs using a structural and cultural framework for WLB policies and WPC accommodations. Further, we discuss levels of deployment in WLB policies and WPC accommodations and how such levels can have differential implications for organizations and its employees. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
17440,"Tweet Storms as Social Movements? Managing Stakeholders in the Social Media Era -- The manner in which social movements influence firms has garnered significant research among organizational scholars. This research has suggested that secondary stakeholders, lacking direct access or power, influence firms through enlisting the support of elites such as the media to increase the salience and urgency of collective actions. However, social media provide secondary stakeholders additional tools to bypass traditional media elites in pressing their agenda. We first develop new theory to describe how collective actions organized using social media influence firms through multiple paths. Specifically, collective actions (e.g., email campaigns, petitions, threats of boycotts) can influence managers directly through reputation threats on social media and indirectly through primary stakeholders who can pressure managers to address the social media propagated issues. We then introduce a new model for firms to manage social movements emanating from social media. The theoretical and practical implications of our model are also discussed."
17460,"Bottled up or Poured out: How Product Name Emotions Affect Appeal and Authenticity -- Although we know that product names influence audience evaluations of producers and their offerings, mechanisms behind the effect remain undertheorized. We propose that a classic psychological stimulus-and-response process is at play. Emotional contagion – ego’s propensity to experience emotions triggered by contact with alters or objects – suggests that product names that convey certain emotions to the consumers of these products will influence their evaluations. While the process is psychological, social context shapes the strength and valence in the stimulus-and-response relationship. We predict that the anti-mass production ideology and oppositional identity of contemporary craft markets (rooted in avid rejection of pecuniary motivation, template marketing, serial production and the like) produce reverse emotional contagion: Positively charged product names lead to negative evaluations of products and negatively charged ones lead to positive evaluations. We also predict a second-order effect of product name emotionality on appeal by way of perceived product authenticity which itself drives appeal in craft markets: Positive emotionality decreases authenticity perceptions and negative emotionality elevates them. We find empirical support for our conjectures in analyses of the U.S. craft beer industry between 1996 and 2012."
17463,"Knowledge Leakage and Institutional Legitimacy in Competitive Dynamics -- Interorganizational ties are ubiquitous and connect businesses to other organizations within their field as well as up- or downstream organizations such as patent prosecutors. In interacting with such parties, companies often must provide knowledge that lies at the core of their competitive advantage to receive the best service possible. Organizations might, thus, be inclined to avoid working with service providers via which indirect links to competitors are created, out of fear of knowledge leakage. However, we argue that forces of legitimation by association with reputable service providers, or even competitors, can counteract fear of knowledge leakage. At higher levels of connectedness to competitors, the selecting organization's fear of knowledge leakage starts taking over and attenuates the probability of choice again. We test our theory studying patent prosecution in the field of computer technologies and find initial support for our proposition"
17555,"The Role of Confucian Moral Virtues in Transforming the Stigma-inducing Moral System -- This study builds theory on the role of traditional moral virtues in enabling actors to transform the stigma-inducing dominant moral system. Drawing on a longitudinal, qualitative study of early private entrepreneurship in China, the findings suggest that stigmatized actors’ continuous moral work involving both rhetoric and enactment of moral virtues can be effective in influencing the dominant moral system, which has been utilized to stigmatize them. Further, the moral work generates feeling of solidarity amongst stigmatized and elicits positive sentiments from the stigmatizers, deepening existing knowledge of audience dynamics in the stigma literature. We discuss the implication of connecting morality with stigma for the study of stigma and social progress. Key words: stigma, morality, moral virtues, qualitative research"
17620,"Agency in network signaling: When do biotech firms signal their alliance formation in press releases -- Social network research suggests that actors are strategic in forming and activating social structures. Actors strategically manage their networks in order to reap the direct benefits of networks such as access to information or resource. Yet, network research has not fully investigated the extent to which agency exists in reaping the indirect benefits of networks. I examine whether agency extends beyond formation and activation to also apply to the signals organizations send to audiences about the status of the partners with which they affiliate. I address the following research question: to what extent does partner’s relative status influence the organization’s choices of sending signals about their networks? In an analysis of press releases about strategic alliance formation by biotechnology firms, I find support for the claim that firms are strategic in sending signals to audiences about their alliance partner. This paper contributes to social network research by connecting research on agency in networks and signaling benefits of networks. The key implication advanced by the paper is that signals about partners constitute another source of network benefit, in addition to the direct materials resources derived from actors’ relations and positions within a social structure."
17628,"Integrating Multiple Sustainability Objectives through Deliberation: The Case of Degrowth Businesses -- In times of pressing global sustainability challenges, companies need to find ways to integrate economic, environmental and social aspects into all their business activities in order to address all sustainability dimensions simultaneously without emphasizing one dimension over another. Degrowth businesses are considered to combine multiple sustainability objectives to an intense degree, while implementing elements of deliberative democracy by enabling and empowering affected people to participate in and actively shape the value creation process. Although recent hybrid organizing research points to the potential of deliberative democracy to support the integration of multiple (contradicting) objectives in organizational contexts, we lack research into the underlying processes and mechanisms. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating how degrowth businesses manage the integration of multiple sustainability objectives. Based on a qualitative-inductive analysis of in-depth interview data, a dynamic model of deliberative objective integration is developed elucidating the dynamic and iterative process of objective integration as a process of steady readjustment in order to achieve stability in the sense that all objectives are achieved simultaneously over time. This model shows that deliberation in organizational contexts represents an effective mechanism that fosters a high degree of objective integration and hence ensures the successful simultaneous pursuit of multiple sustainability objectives over time."
17661,"Organizational Routines and Adaptability: The Effects of Routines in Building TMS -- Organizational routines are ubiquitous stores of knowledge in organizations. Although routines enable consistent performance on tasks over time, routines might hinder adaptability by promoting inertia and rigidity. In this dissertation, I develop how routines could facilitate adaptation in organizations and foster successful performance on novel tasks. I argue that teams are changed in the process of using routines. I develop and test theory arguing that routines can facilitate the development of transactive memory systems (TMS), collective systems for encoding, storing, and sharing knowledge. I propose that routines provide a structure within which team members can learn about one another’s skills. Thus, routines can build a team’s TMS, which can improve performance on novel tasks. I use a mixed-methods design to both develop and to test theory. In Study 1, I performed 30 semi-structured interviews with United States Marine Corps officers. Based on interview findings, I hypothesize that teams that use routines will develop stronger transactive memory systems than teams that do not. Consequently, I hypothesize that teams that use routines will perform better on novel tasks due to the TMS they have developed. In Study 2, I developed a laboratory study in the cybersecurity context to test the hypotheses. Two hundred and thirteen participants in 71 teams were randomly assigned to perform a task with a routine or without a routine, and then perform a novel task. Results provide evidence to support the hypotheses."
17662,"DYNAMIC INERTIA: How organizations avoid adapting to changes in the environment -- What prevents organizations from adapting to substantial environmental changes? Research from a performative perspective has challenged traditional accounts of cognitive and structural inertia by highlighting how organizational actors dynamically enact routines in a manner that engenders change or stability. However, a puzzle remains: When responding to substantial changes in the environment, how do organizational actors generate inertia? We investigate this question by conducting an inductive, historical study of the credit rating routine of Moody’s, an organization that failed to adapt to substantial changes in its environment in the run up to the financial crisis of 2008. Our analysis of the actions associated with the re-designing of central artifacts and the enactment of the routine reveals six mechanisms by which organizational actors generate inertia. First, when re-designing artifacts, actors generate inertia through bounded retheorizing of the model, the sedimentation of assumptions, and mythical modeling of the unknown. Second, when enacting routines, organizational actors generate inertia by justifying their response to environmental changes through maintaining comprehensibility, appeasing prevailing stakeholders, and exercising professional discretion. Our historical case study contributes to our understanding of organizational inertia, routine dynamics, and the financial crisis of 2008."
17850,"Maintaining a Mandate of Meaningfulness: The Occupation of Career Advisers in Business Schools -- Every occupation requires an occupational mandate to uphold its legitimacy. The mandates literature focuses on nascent occupations constructing mandates through the enactment of occupational values. However, even for mature occupations, mandates require maintenance, and this maintenance might be challenged when the occupation exists in an organization whose values misalign with occupational values. We examine career advisers in undergraduate business schools, a mature occupation whose values around helping students achieve purpose and fit in careers misalign with organizational values held among business school students around wealth or prestige and conformity. We conduct an ethnography of career advisers at an undergraduate business school, combined with an interview study of such advisers throughout the U.S. We find that advisers maintain their mandate through several practices, differentiated by interactional setting and audience. In one-on-one advising sessions, career advisers discerned the alignment between the student’s ambitions and advisers’ values. Advisers enacted value-moderating practices when they perceived student misalignment with advisers’ values, and they engaged in value-magnifying practices when they perceived alignment or openness. In group settings where assessing value congruence was infeasible, advisers engaged in value-masking practices, where they obfuscated values that could conflict with values of students, students’ parents, or business school administrators. Overall, this study shows how members of a mature occupation—whose values misalign with organizational values—actively maintain their mandate by discerning between audiences and occasionally concealing rather than revealing their values."
17967,"Wage Stagnation and the Rise of Merit Pay, 1974-1991 -- In the 1970s, US workers' wages stopped growing and steadily declined through the mid-1990s. During this time, employers experimented with employment practices, like merit pay, that seemed likely to raise pay and productivity. We argue on the contrary that the introduction of merit pay actually weakened organizational constraints that previously boosted pay. First, merit pay practices loosen pay fairness constraints justifying pay gaps on the basis of performance differences. Second, merit pay substitutes for efficiency wages, by providing an alternative mechanism through which employers can elicit worker effort. To test these ideas, we introduce new establishment-by-occupation microdata covering the critical early period of wage stagnation. We show that when establishments adopt merit pay, wages decline. These effects are concentrated on the lowest-paid workers within a job; the lower paid jobs within a workplace; and in the highest-paying blue collar workplaces. The spread of merit-based pay explains one sixth to one third of wage stagnation for low-skilled workers during this period. Organizational practices aggregate up to affect societal trends in inequality and wage growth."
17976,"Soft power strategies: the non-market interactions of corporations and governments -- Resource dependence theory and the field of strategy have drawn attention to corporations use of political action—attempts to shape government decision making in ways favorable to the firm. Yet scant attention has been paid to political action as a process, through which both corporations and governments participate and interact. Utilising recently declassified archival files, we develop an historical case study of how the U.K. government interacted with Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s to secure the highest possible credit rating in 1978, despite receiving an International Monetary Fund bailout two years earlier. Drawing on this case, we develop a process model to offer the first explanation of why and how governments pursue political action to influence corporations. By attending to how corporations and governments interact, we elaborate the unobtrusive function of soft power that has received limited attention in resource dependence theory and been overlooked in corporate political action."
17986,"Two Popes: Religion and Conflicting Institutional Logics Influence on Social Movement Outcomes -- In this paper we aim to understand the relationship between religion, institutional logics, and social movements outcomes. Empirically, we look at the Solidarity Economy Movement (SEM) in Brazil where the Catholic Church had a prominent role in disseminating solidarity economy enterprises. Using a mixed-method approach, we analyze and test how conflicting logics of the Catholic Church influence the work of Caritas (a social movement organization). Our results contribute to the social movement and institutional logics literature."
18016,"Interpersonal, intergroup, and interspecies identity as antecedents of resistance to change -- In light of increasing digitization and the so-called ‘4th industrial revolution’, managers and scholars alike strive to better understand employees’ resistance to organizational change (RTC)—in particular technology-related change—and its antecedents. We explore whether, and if so, how employees’ identities at the interpersonal, intergroup, and interspecies level influence resistance to technology-related organizational change. Based on self-categorization theory, we develop a conceptual framework with an individual’s perception of threat by recent technological advances as mediator. We test our model based on a mixed method design (interviews, pilot survey, field study). Analyses of the main field study show a mediated hampering effect of technological identity (interpersonal level) and a mediated boosting effect of (local) socio-linguistic identity in relation to management (intergroup level), and human identity (interspecies level) on RTC. We derive practical and theoretical implications for research on organizational change, on employee identity, and on change-related communication and foreign language in business."
18301,"Protests As A Double-Edged Sword In Emerging Industries: Evidence From The Commercial Drone Industry -- Although emerging industries are increasingly seen as the outcome of social movement processes, protests have seldom been studied as sources of the liabilities of newness. We find that that anti-technology protests exert two effects: on the one hand, they amplify perceptions of risk about the new technology and impede entrepreneurial entry, but on the other hand, protests create a demand for regulation, and in turn, regulations authorize a new technology and facilitate entrepreneurial entry. Thus, protests are a double-edged sword in emerging industries; they produce liabilities of newness by constructing risk, but attenuate the liabilities of newness due to their effects on regulation. We discuss the implications for social movements, entrepreneurship, and science and technology studies."
18327,"Venturing with Caution: Insights into the Investment Strategy of Venture Capital Firms -- The literature on portfolio diversification in venture capital contrasts industry specialization as a strategy that helps venture capital firms leverage accumulated industry expertise to diversification as strategy that spreads risk and allows venture capital firms to select riskier, higher-ceiling ventures within each industry. These strategies are generally treated as mutually exclusive and focus on firms' internal expertise. We introduce a social perspective to this literature to argue that firms at different positions in the inter-firm status hierarchy have varying strategic incentives for diversifying their portfolios and also to resolve the trade-off between diversification and specialization. For venture capital firms at the bottom of the status hierarchy, diversification provides a means to seek out riskier ventures that offsets accessing relatively worse equity positions within syndicated investments. For firms with moderate status, specialization provides a means to improve confidence in their credibility to manage investments successfully, improving their ability to gain better equity positions. Firms at the top of the status hierarchy leverage their social influence to coordinate closely related external expertise of syndicate co-investors when the diversify and spread their risk across industry categories while still leveraging specialized knowledge to manage ventures successfully. Analysis of investments made by venture capital firms from 1990 to 2018 reveals that firms low and high in the status hierarchy diversify their portfolios more than firms in the middle of the status hierarchy. When firms higher in the status hierarchy diversify their portfolios, their syndicated investments involving other co-investing firms reflect domain expertise more closely related to the venture company's industry category."
18539,"Communicating sense: The role of inference in joint sensemaking in equivocal contexts -- In this paper, we build a conceptual framework that elaborates the communicative mechanisms by which individuals in high reliability organizations (HROs) jointly make sense in order to coordinate in equivocal contexts. We build on past work in cognitive and discursive sensemaking, while also highlighting that past research tends to conflate cognition and discourse by presupposing cognitive effects of discourse. Instead, we submit that sensemaking research would benefit from a focus on how organizational actors make inferences and build shared understanding in context. We provide this analytical focus on inference by borrowing theoretical principles and assumptions from relevance theory, a theory in the neighboring field of pragmatic linguistics, and illustrating these principles with examples from seminal past cases of sensemaking under pressure. Our conceptual framework exposes the communicative processes of ostension and inference by which actors build a mutual cognitive environment. Crucially, our paper underscores the importance of investigating how failed inferences hinder coordinated action. We elaborate the contributions of our conceptual framework to sensemaking research, reexamining the concepts of equivocality, requisite variety, and double interacts from a communication standpoint."
18636,"Entrepreneurship as a Response to Labor Market Discrimination for Formerly Incarcerated People -- This paper examines entrepreneurship as a way to overcome labor market discrimination. Specifically, we examine entrepreneurship as a career choice for formerly incarcerated individuals, a group of individuals who face substantial discrimination in the labor market. Using the United States National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 data, we find that formerly incarcerated people are more likely to become entrepreneurs compared to individuals without a criminal record. We take advantage of an exogenous state and county level policy shock “Ban-the-Box” in the United States to further disentangle the underlying mechanism of how labor market discrimination affects formerly incarcerated individuals in their entrepreneurial choices. The findings suggest that entrepreneurship is a viable alternative career choice for formerly incarcerated people, yielding both higher income and lower recidivism rates. In addition to reporting robustness checks and addressing alternative explanations, we discuss theoretical, empirical, and policy implications."
18689,"Collective rage, power, and institutions: Examining institutional disruption, defense and reaction -- Abstract: In this paper we explore the role of the collective emotion rage in institutional disruption and change. While rage is considered a form of anger, the unique and intense experience of collective rage and potential for disruption deserves focused attention. We argue that rage can be experienced collectively as well as can be collectively suppressed or can be expressed in a number of ways. When such collective rage is expressed, various forms of collective institutional disruption may occur. We also argue that institutional guardians are likely to resist that disruption and engage in defensive and reactionary behaviors to defend existing institutional structures."
18769,"What does it take to engage with paradoxes: the challenge of persistence -- This paper explores how actors engage with persistent paradoxes over time. Drawing on a two-year participant observation of institutional investors involved in developing a framework for ESG investing, we identify four efforts actors engage in: anchoring, experimenting, ordering and creating a safe zone. Actors do not constantly engage in those four efforts but alternate between moments of active engagement and moments of indirect engagement. This alternation enable them to engage with the paradox over a long period of time, by varying the depth of their engagement. Our study concludes that saliency is not a stable and single state but that there are different manifestations of saliency along a spectrum, contributing in making the paradoxes livable and manageable. Difficult emotions and a sense of purpose and urgency trigger oscillations between direct and indirect engagement with paradoxes."
18820,"Start-up Templates and Nascent Entrepreneurship among Women -- In under-developed contexts, women’s choice of engaging in entrepreneurial activity is constrained due to limited access to knowledge about entrepreneurship processes. We find that start-up templates, defined as codified series of prototypical founding tasks, can provide such knowledge and motivate women to initiate pre-entry activities. In a field experiment design in rural India, we randomly selected a sample of unemployed women for exposure to customized start-up templates, and then observed their decision to initiate pre-entry activity through their sign-ups for a paid enterprise training program. We find that 50% more women sign up when they are exposed to start-up templates as compared to the control group. We further investigate whether this effect is influenced by the template’s description of actions and resources for carrying out the founding tasks. We find that the rate of sign-ups is 24% higher when the start-up templates emphasize the use of social connections, as compared to relying on individual selves. This paper provides causal empirical evidence of how templates can provide entrepreneurial knowledge required for reducing uncertainty and increasing the likelihood of entrepreneurship."
18857,"Your Secrets are Safe with Me? Audience Response to the Exit of Partners with Brokerage Advantage -- The choice of a firm’s exchange partner is an important decision that affects the quality of resources a firm gets. These partners generate social capital by acting as conduits of information flow between a firm and the market. The position where these exchange partners are situated within the organizational network enables access to valuable proprietary information about firms. Hence, the exit of such an exchange partner holding information advantage is expected to invoke a response from the market participants. We tested this by exploiting a unique natural experiment in India where the government made it mandatory for firms to change their auditors at least once every 10 years. We observe a positive response when firms lose an exchange partner holding diverse network positions. However, the response to losing the same is negative when firms associated with the partner are tainted with earnings management or corporate illegality. It is observed that the market is keen to let go of exchange partners with an informational advantage. However, if an exchange partner with information advantage is exiting a tainted entity then the market reacts negatively due to possible fear of unearthing potentially harmful information about the firm in future."
18860,"Framing and complexity: Evidence from the Federal Reserve -- This paper investigates the role of cognitive framing in decision makers’ ability to perceive complexity. Qualitatively studying the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy making committee, the FOMC, and conceptualizing its policy as a complex set of separate but interdependent choices, the paper finds that framing both enables committee members to attend complexity and hinders their ability to do so. By focusing a decision maker’s attention on a few features of the environment, a cognitive frame can effectively push her to perceive interdependencies not visible without that focus. However, by screening out many other features of the environment, interdependencies amongst these are ignored. A (single) frame therefore helps one to perceive low-levels of complexity but hinders the attainment of higher-levels of complexity. In highly complex environments, decision makers should thus exhibit frame heterogeneity, allowing them to attend the problem at hand through multiple frames. The paper has practical implications to the design of a broad range of decision making groups: it is argued that if the group is confronted with complex problems, individual members ought to exhibit sufficiently varied frames on their own: heterogeneity at the group-level is not enough. Finally, the paper complements recent research on frames in the FOMC."
18923,"Perceived Differentiation and Audience Support to Institutional Change in British Politics -- Previous research suggests that insufficient differentiation of organizations occupying central positions in an organizational field increases the possibility of a status quo threatening institutional change. Directly testing the relationship, the present study reveals a more complex picture of the linkages between organizational differentiation and institutional change. Drawing on developments in British politics, our study demonstrates that when the differentiation dimension of left-right politics was on decline, perceived differentiation of the major parties, instead of decreasing, increased audience support to a status quo threatening- electoral institutional change from FPPS (First Past the Post System) to PR (Proportional Representation). We further observe in a counter-intuitive manner that the increase in audience support to the electoral institutional change from FPPS to PR, however, weakened with the passage of time. We use both qualitative and quantitative evidence from the context of British politics to support and test our theoretical arguments. In particular, we found support for our theoretical hypotheses in analyses of data from British Election Surveys during the period from 1987 to 2001, which enabled direct measurement of the perceived differentiation of the two central parties (i.e., the Conservatives and the Labour) in British politics along the differentiating dimension of left-right politics and the voter support for an electoral institutional change from FPPS to PR."
18965,"Material identity work and reinforcement of collective identity in times of loss -- The death of a central figure, like a charismatic founder, can dilute the sense of collective identity among the various stakeholders of a local community. Maintenance of collective identity can be a difficult task, because the organization needs to then simultaneously deal with multiple identity drifts. We conducted an inductive study of Finnish company Ponsse, the founder recently passed away. The second-generation chairman took the lead to articulate the values that implicitly prevailed during the leadership of the founder. Our findings show that organizations that experience a loss can maintain and strengthen their collective identity after the passing of a charismatic leader by engaging in material identity work. Our study highlights two phases underlying the process of reinforcing the collective identity: creating the material environment and enacting material experiences. We contribute to deepen current understanding of how collective identities can be reinforced after a major loss by illuminating the material underpinnings of identity work."
18985,"Multivocality in the emergence of impact investing in Spain: Creating new roles and responsibilities -- Interstitial issue fields offer important opportunities for collaboration across sectors, but they also pose significant challenges because field members come with diverse and often opposed value systems and evaluative criteria. Recent research has shown that multivocality can enable collaboration in such contexts, as it promotes coordination without the need for consensus. We explore these issues in the context of the emergence of impact investing in Spain, where we have carried out a field-level study based on interviews and continued participant observation, with especial emphasis on the case of social impact bonds. We find that multivocality is indeed relevant in the process of field emergence, but that it is through its interplay with calculability – reaching consensus over new calculative practices – that field members acquire new roles and responsibilities. We hence contribute to the literature on field emergence by showing the complementarity between multivocality and calculability, and to the literature on impact investing by suggesting how impact measurement and social impact bonds can drive significant changes in actors’ roles and accountability."
18998,"Does Collective always mean Cohesive? Collective Institutional Entrepreneurship and Radical Flanks -- Despite an expanding literature on collective institutional entrepreneurship, we know little about the mechanics and internal dynamics between different and potentially divergent entrepreneurial paths, the responses from actors outside the collective, and the effects that divergent entrepreneurial paths have on the outcome of the institutional change project. In this paper, we set out to explore how diverse paths in collective institutional entrepreneurship can contribute to institutional change. Informed by literature on collective institutional entrepreneurship and radical flank effects and relying on qualitative processual data on a collective attempt to change the standards in Type-1 diabetes healthcare, we show how multiple and diverse entrepreneurial paths interweave in the pursuit of a common institutional change project. We contribute to literature on collective institutional entrepreneurship by detailing the mechanisms that yield synergetic and dynamic relationships between entrepreneurial actors (creating urgency, creating the network and creating the cohesion) and by detailing how different types of institutional work undertaken by the different groups contribute to institutional change over time. We also contribute to literature on radical flank effects by demonstrating how emotional cohesion functions as a social glue that connects discrepant entrepreneurial paths in a common institutional change project."
19068,"Influence of different types of Reputation on Art investments: an Experimental Study -- In this paper we investigate how different types of reputation influence on the perceived investment potential of an artwork. To address this question, we conduct a 2x2x2 between-subjects anonymous online experiment. We examine the effects of expert, marker, and peer reputations of the perceived investment potential of an artwork. Moreover, we examine whether these effects depend on the visual attractiveness of an artwork. The results of our study extend our knowledge on the influence of social evaluations on art investments. We combine economic perspective on art markets (Campbell, 2009; Lovo, Spaenjers, 2018; Renneboog, Spaenjers, 2013; Worthington, Higgs, 2004) with research on social evaluations (Lange, Lee, Dai, 2011; Pollock et al., 2019; Rindova et al., 2005) by showing the importance of social evaluations for the investments decisions. Moreover, we extent research on multiplicity of reputations (Boutinot et al., 2017; Ertug et al., 2016; Fini et al., 2018; Jensen, Kim, Kim, 2011; Kim, Jensen, 2014) by clarifying the influence of different audience-specific reputations and showing that they can have both positive and negative effects on investment potential perceptions within art markets. Our study also contributes to the growing stream of literature on the commercialization of culture and commodification of art objects (Beckert, Rössel, 2013; Velthuis, 2007)."
19078,"Varieties of Moral Agency: Overcoming Moral Paralysis in Organizations -- In this paper, we introduce the concept of moral paralysis to explain a tendency to give priority to avoiding harm over doing good in particular organizational contexts. The discussion starts from an example from a nursing home, where a depressed resident is invited on a motorcycle trip to give her a positive and energizing experience. It illustrates an initiative to prioritize moral agency aiming to benefit another person over moral agency geared towards avoidance of harm. Informants to this study have indicated that moral agency of this kind is rare, since it involves a risk of causing harm, and a risk of professional repercussions if the outcome is negative. Moral paralysis occurs when decision-makers are reluctant to engage in prescriptive moral agency, due to a perceived lack of protection against negative consequences. We argue that previous theories have conflated prescriptive and proscriptive moral agency on the one hand, with action and inaction on the other, and propose a model that combines these two dimensions of moral agency. We also apply the concept of moral luck to explain the emergence of moral paralysis."
19111,"Sometimes More: The Effect of Preference Diversity on Exploration -- This study investigates how preference diversity affects the amount of exploration a prototypical organization – a majority voting triad – perform while learning in an uncertain environment. We employ a multi-agent-based model to study this question as an extension of the prior models on learning under uncertainty. We find that preference diversity (i.e. how different are the preferences of the least similar agents in the triad) can increase (+15%) or decrease exploration (-50%) when compared to triads with homogenous preferences. We find that when the diverse preferences are balanced (i.e., the median agent is equidistant to the other two agents) then exploration is higher. Conversely, exploration decreases when the preferences are imbalanced (i.e., two agents have preference close together). The paper explores further aspects that affect exploration, as organization size, preference polarization in larger organizations, and the type of environment. All further analyses maintain the general finding of the paper, namely: Preference diversity on its own does not explain the amount of exploration done by an organization."
19139,"The Cultural and Commercial Production of Leadership -- Scholars have long criticized the commercialization of leadership, leadership education, and leadership development—some to distinguish what they consider legitimate research and practice from mass-market “bullshit,” others to characterize the whole notion of leadership as an ideological ruse or empty signifier. But neither critique rests on an adequate foundation of theory or empirical research regarding the actors, institutions, and industries that drive and profit from the commercialization of leadership. We therefore draw from the production of culture literature, Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology of cultural fields, Roger Friedland’s critique of Bourdieu, and our own work on leadership fashions to develop a theoretical framework fit to explore the cultural and commercial production of concepts, discourses, products and services via the leadership industries. A deeper understanding of the competitive and industrial dynamics behind these industries promises to contribute fresh perspectives on the proliferation of so many approaches to leadership; on the industrialized production rather than just the social construction of those approaches; on the continued predominance of romanticized and individualized prescriptions over against more sociologically nuanced theories of relational and collective leadership; and on the central role that scholars themselves play in the leadership industries, and in the production and reproduction of leadership."
19144,"Cooperation and Competition within Organizations: A Multi-Level View -- In this article we examine simultaneous cooperation and competition within organizations, with a specific focus on teams and their members. We extend theory on how the different levels involved with ‘coopetition’ interact; how activity at one level influences activity at another level. Our approach of simulation-assisted theory building unpacks our overall contribution to understanding the multi-leveled nature of coopetition by illustrating three main insights. First, competition between two - or more - teams, encourages cooperation between team members who also compete with each other. Second, the relationship between value creation and appropriation is bidirectional; that is, creation at the level of the team influences appropriation at the level of the individual, and vice versa. Third, there are specific conditions under which selfishness, or ‘non-cooperation’, is optimal at the individual level, including the comparative extent of altruism at the team level, and the point in time at which such a strategy is leveraged. We primarily contribute to the coopetition literature. However, such theory also has implications for practice, as it informs managers how best to organize their teams for optimal value creation and performance."
19187,"Engaging with Institutional Voids in Contexts of Poverty: The African Wildlife Foundation in Kenya -- Drawing on a historical case study of the African Wildlife Foundation from 1960 to 2015, we propose a dynamic model of institutional void experience, enactment and theorization as guided by an evolving constellation of institutional logics. We show that micro-level practices embedded in particular institutional logics can collide with social reality and hamper the organization in achieving its mission (void experience), which prompts organizations to experiment with novel solutions embedded in seemingly opposite logics (void enactment) and leverage their organizational identity to legitimate these novel solutions (void theorization) in a cyclical manner. By adopting a social constructivist lens in studying voids, we provide a fresh perspective on institutional voids and address scholarly calls for a synthesis of international business and institutional theory. We also shed light on the role of agency in the emergence of logic constellations at the organizational field-level and emphasize the role of organizational identity as an enabling mechanism in this process."
19346,"How Do We Find Meaningfulness in Work? A Process Theory Based on the Dialogic Practice -- Experiencing work as meaningful is a central desire for individuals in organizations, but scholars face three challenges that together hinder research progress. Current works on work meaningfulness (WM) fall short in: (1) conceptualizing the inherently processual nature of WM; (2) accounting for the social, other-oriented dimension in WM process; and (3) addressing the tensional and paradoxical nature of WM. We argue that these are interrelated issues arising from the dominance of representational ontology in WM research, and propose the adoption of relational ontology in addressing them. Blending practice approach and dialogic perspective, we develop a dialogic practice theory of WM and generate three central insights. We theorize that, firstly, a person’s WM emerges in the purposive engagement in practices and changes in his/her becoming aware of the inherent tensions and contradictions in such engagement. Secondly, this awareness prompts the person to re-evaluate his/her purposive engagement and justification. Thirdly, this re-evaluation leads to the differential positioning of the self in relation with and in contrast to others through inquiring, selecting, and crafting the self-other dialogues. In sum, this cycle of purposive engagement, awareness, re-evaluation, and differential positioning suggests a theoretical model that captures the social, processual, and tensional nature of WM."
19349,"The Impact of Peer and Industry Characteristics on Peer Failure Experience and Investment Intensity -- Most studies on learning from failure have focused on the strategic incentives of a focal firm. We examine the relationship between peer failure and investment intensity from external actors’ point of view and argue that peer failure can be a negative signal to external actors due to a harm spill-over effect, restricting a firm’s actions. Our analysis of the U.S. movie industry shows that peer failure leads to a decrease in investment intensity, the relationship attenuated by peer recognition and industry growth. Our study highlights the role of external actors that shape a firm’s ability to learn and take action."
19352,"Reproduction by decoupled innovation -- This paper analyzes how new ideas imported to an institutional field in crisis as solutions to efficiency demands can sustain organizational conformity. Studying the exemplary case of a highly acclaimed innovation project in a leading legacy newspaper, my findings suggest that, even in conditions of decreasing organizational efficiency and apparent institutional failure, the transposition of new ideas can reproduce existing institutional arrangements. The process model I propose explains how this happens in a process of empty translation that removes diverging meaning from imported ideas, decoupling the transposed policy from actual practice. The suggested theoretical model provides insights to translation and decoupling micro-level dynamics and their effect on isomorphism."
19363,"How to learn from the man in the mirror: Navigating paradoxes through self-reflexivity -- In the light of increased organizational and environmental complexity, research turns ever more often to the notion of paradox to investigate how managers can navigate conflicting demands. However, the internal dynamics of paradox remain unclear, making it difficult to understand what exactly is meant by the concept, and how it can be managed in practice. This article notes that the full potential of paradox as an analytical tool for understanding complex situations of organizational life has not been reached, and reveals instances of organizational complexity that appear even more radical than current definitions of paradox posit. Using the sociologist Niklas Luhmann’s concepts of distinction and re-entry, we unfold the complexity of such situations and develop a typology that includes a novel type of paradox that appears underexplored. Illustrating several different ways that opposites can appear interdependent, interwoven, persistent, and synergistic, we contribute to theory-building within paradox research. Finally, we discuss our findings and managerial implications and point towards future research."
19380,"With Frenemies Like These: Social Networks Ties and Interpersonal Citizenship Behaviors -- This study examines the relationship between the type of social network tie shared between two individuals—positive, negative, or ambivalent multiplex (both positive and negative tie components)—and the performance of interpersonal citizenship behavior (ICB), a form of individually-targeted organizational citizenship behavior. Drawing from ego depletion theory, social exchange theory, and the social functions of emotions perspective, we argue that dyadic relational qualities influence the individual’s decision to perform ICBs. Further, based on social categorization theory and social information processing theory, we posit that the number of positive alters a dyad shares increases the probability of ICB. We test the theoretical model in a study including 48 employees of a supplier organization for large retailers and food service companies using exponential random graph models (ERGMs). Results offer support for the hypothesized relationships, and the practical implications, as well as future research questions, are addressed."
19424,"Buffering and bridging under institutional complexity - A configurational approach towards CVC -- Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) units are hybrid organizations facing multiple institutional demands and inconsistent organizational goals. By employing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 23 CVC units, we empirically explore how these hybrids configure and design their organizational structure to respond to institutional complexity and sustain hybridity over time. We identify two contextual variables - maturity and strategic focus - that influence how these hybrid organizations organize for high strategic performance. We find that successful responses of organizations facing institutional complexity are multifaceted, dynamic, and change over time as strategy and stakeholder demands vary. We contribute to institutional theory by introducing the concept of buffering and bridging to explain how successful hybrid organizations distance themselves from the institutional logic they originate when they become more mature (buffering). At the same time, they increase their efforts to maintain connections to representatives of the logic they stem from (bridging)."
19457,"Product Experience and Learning to Identify Opportunities: Evidence from Mobile App Developers -- This paper examines how firms identify opportunities from their product development experience and how such learning affects the launch of subsequent products. I develop a theoretical framework that focuses on how the breadth and depth of experience provides information on opportunities in uncertain environments. Specifically, I created the concept of functionality that captures what purposes firms’ products provide for the customers. I predict that product experience allows firms to learn about the underlying functionalities and they use such information to guide subsequent product launches. Using fine-grained data on mobile application developers in the US Apple Store ecosystem, I find that firms with greater functionality breadth in their prior product experience are more likely to launch new product, and the effect is largely in firms’ core functionalities rather than peripheral and new ones. In particular, these new product launches tend to highlight more of these core functionalities as opposed to recombining with new functionalities. These findings suggest that in uncertain environments, experience breadth has the surprising merit of enabling firms to gain greater clarity in their core functionalities through establishing the boundaries and connections of different functionalities."
19518,"How to Stay Weird – The Normative Subordination of Profits in a Firm Striving for Sustainability -- Humanity faces an unprecedented urgency to act in order to achieve sustainable development. Against this background, firms play an ambivalent role, since they have great potential to contribute to sustainable development, but their common normative focus on profit maximization leads to increasing rather than decreasing sustainability problems. Whereas integrative and paradox research on sustainability breaks away from the instrumentalism underlying profit maximization, research still lacks a theoretical account of firms enacting sustainability more radically, even at the expense of economic success. With an in-depth ethnographic study, this paper investigates a natural cosmetic producing firm that normatively superordinates ecological and social considerations over profits in its practices. We take a practice-based approach and unearth how firms are able to maintain a radical focus on sustainability in several practices through a recursive, tension-mitigating mechanism spiraled by highly sustainability-oriented selling and supplier management practices. This paper contributes to research on sustainability in organization and management studies by discovering approaches that enable firms to superordinate ecological and social ends over profits in multiple practices and thereby contribute to the urgent radical shift towards sustainability."
19541,"Category-Featuring Names and Analyst Reactions to Corporate Environmental Actions -- In this study, we develop a novel mechanism through which nonconforming organizations can survive and thrive. Building on recent developments in categories literature, we propose that audiences’ category taken-for-grantedness, evoked by firms’ category-featuring names, opens strategic opportunities for firms to escape from audiences’ illegitimate discounts and even retain audiences’ enhanced valuation. We test our predictions using security analysts’ reactions to Chinese public firms’ environmental actions between 2008 and 2014. Our findings demonstrate that a firm’s explicit feature in its name that shaped by historical categorization can have profound impacts on analysts’ legitimacy and value judgments of contemporary corporate behaviors."
19585,"Why informal firms formalize: A strategic decision-making perspective -- We offer a behavioural framework to explain informal firms’ decision to formalize. We argue that aspirations for which firms skirt formal regulation to operate in the informal economy serve as reference points in interpreting and evaluating the prospect of formalization. We differentiate between the influences of firms expected performance relative to aspired performance and the influence of different form of aspiration being pursued (aspirations related to subsistence, exploitation, legacy, and resistance). In conclusion, we contribute to extant research emphasizing formalization as a quasi-rational calculation by recognizing how formalization can be seen as a complex decisions-making process surrounded by severe information incompleteness and uncertainty."
19615,"Making paradoxical tensions salient: changing information not people -- Many firms are confronted with paradoxical tensions. For firms to recognize tensions these have to become salient. Prior research suggests that environmental and cognitive factors render latent tensions salient and argues implicitly that where environmental factors are complex, paradoxical cognition is required. In this paper we present the general model of rendering paradoxical tensions salient where developing cognition is only one of three possible strategies. We argue that information must fit both a described situation and actors’ cognition for latent tensions to become salient. Based on this condition we introduce the other two alternative ways to make tensions salient, i.e. simplification of the information and simplification of the situation, that have been overlooked by scholars. Using the doubly complex application of coopetition for sustainability we show how the strategy of simplification of the information can help to recognize and systemize paradoxical tensions."
19620,"Integration of Competing Logics through Anchoring and Recontextualization -- Integration of organizational elements from competing institutional logic archetypes can provide tremendous value for society through the hybrid organization. Despite these potential benefits, most work on hybrid integration stops at inclusion of elements within the organization with subsequent isolation or leaves the relationships within and between organizational elements under-explored. Within two social enterprises striving to attain social and financial objectives in the context of resource-poor solar energy markets, we show that integration within the hybrid organization is facilitated through anchoring on a logic archetype, empowerment of the non-anchor logic, and recontextualization of each of the non-anchor elements included. Recontextualization within the anchored organizational configuration enabled using the non-anchor elements in ways that shifted from independent contentious trade-offs to supportive interdependent complements. The emergence and supporting evidence are given along with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications"
19629,"Learning What They Think vs. Learning What They Do: Two Mechanisms of Vicarious Learning -- Vicarious learning is a vital component of organizational learning. However, as new technologies emerge that have the potential to improve vicarious learning among individuals and between humans and algorithms, our lack of conceptual clarity about it’s underlying mechanisms may impede our ability to benefit from them. We theorize and model two fundamental processes underlying vicarious learning: observation of actions (learning what they do) vs. belief sharing (learning what they think). The analysis of our model points to two key insights. First, vicarious learning through belief sharing is not universally better than simple mutual observation of actions and outcomes. Specifically, enabling mutual observability of actions and outcomes is superior to sharing of beliefs when the task environment features few alternatives with large differences in their value and there are no time pressures. Second, the superiority of vicarious learning through belief sharing in more complex task environments with time constraints does not require any differential wisdom ex ante among the learners. Both results are shown to be the consequence of a key mechanism – how vicarious learning affects self-confirming biases."
19637,"Some Organizational Antecedents of Evil -- Employees sometimes engage in acts of evil, particularly towards people under their care or control. Using a situationist perspective, we examine the sadistic abuse of vulnerable patients by care home staff. Our theory links organizational control to pathways to abuse. Observations on 14,000 care homes between 2006-2014 show that the neglect of patients, minor rule breaches, and physical restraint escalate into active sadistic behavior. A lack of both informal and formal monitoring mechanisms gives rise to these gradual pathways, although forms of formal supervision – both by managers and team leaders – largely fail to curtail the abuse. Whereas prior research focused on how organizational measures around control, rules, and monitoring can unleash positive employee behaviors such as creativity, our findings indicate that organizational context can also unleash the darker inclinations in human behavior."
19662,"Coordination of Search: A Processual Approach -- Coordination of search by several agents when interdependencies and uncertainty characterize the environment is a difficult yet critical task. The core difficulty, compared to search by a single agent, is for each agent to take into account the other’s actions and choices in her own learning process. A well-known solution to this problem is building a common knowledge. Common knowledge provides a complete framework in which each agent can make sense of the problem at hand and of the other’s actions. Yet, several recent case studies evidence that coordination of search is possible even when building common knowledge is impossible. These studies show that adopting a processual approach to coordination, i.e. varying the behavior of agents over time, permits efficient search without common knowledge. We resort to a computational model to investigate the conditions under which a processual coordination of search can be successful. We vary over time two key dimensions: the nature of agents’ cognitive effort (i.e. whether they explore or try to converge towards a common solution) and interactions (i.e. the extent to which they are tolerant to errors). Our results show that a processual coordination of search is efficient when agents first only explore with a maximum tolerance to errors and then purely converge towards a common solution while progressively reducing their tolerance to errors. The key to the success of the multiagent search is that, from one agent perspective, the others’ behaviors are stabilized so that they can be handled in conducting one’s own learning process."
19761,"Working with the ‘Enemy’: Free Space in Facilitating Cold War Space Collaboration -- Although collaboration between competing organizations is one of the most challenging tasks in management, our knowledge about social-cognitive mechanisms that facilitate the collaborative interaction between members of competing organizations is rather limited. We conducted an inductive, interpretive historical case study of the collaboration between the US and USSR space programs during the Cold War. Our study uncovers a process by which individuals used a “free space,” i.e., social space in which organizational members cognitively severed themselves from the higher-level ideological/political tension by initiating and maintaining informal and isolated interactions with their collaborative counterparts. The concept of “free space” has profound implications for analyzing effective collaboration between competing organizations in both market and nonmarket contexts."
19806,"Configuration of Institutional Entrepreneurial Opportunities -- The paper develops a middle-range theory - rooted in the ‘configuration’ principles of sociology and organization theory - to explain how the different configurations of macro institutional and micro individual conditions trigger different actions that begin distinct IEO creation processes. It is theorized that during the opportunity creation process, micro and macro conditions may change, giving rise to new configurations. Our conceptualization of multiple types of configurations that trigger individual actions in parallel and in sequence that, when successful, together lead to the creation of the demand and/or solution(s) for institutional change advances a granular understanding of the triggering of the moving forward of institutional change. In particular, this theorization provides a framework to fulfill our knowledge gap to systematically study the heterogeneity in the triggering of actions and their evolution in the institutional entrepreneurial opportunity creation process."
19830,"Organizational learning of cultures: The spawned culture effects in the U.S. IT industry -- Scholars often compare new ventures to babies, but most founders are experienced and enculturated even if their startups are young—a paradox of new ventures. New ventures start in a cultural void, but their founders are often already encultured to the parent organization’s cultural codes. This study investigates whether founders fill the cultural void with the cultural repertoires of their parent organization. Founders enculturated in prior employment are more likely to adopt familiar cultural repertoires, resulting in a spawned startup becoming culturally similar to its parent. This spawned culture effect is stronger when founders are more socialized (have longer tenure), when the parent culture is more legitimate (less atypical) and coherent (has high cultural congruency). Finally, this study explores which cultural repertoires predict better performance and whether those are more likely to be inherited by spawned startups. If less likely to be inherited, this implies that organizational culture can be a source of a firm’s competitive advantage. These ideas are examined in a longitudinal analysis of 3,570 startups in the U.S. IT industry from 2008 through 2019. Implications for the study of organizational learning, organizational culture, and entrepreneurship are discussed."
19840,"Antecedents of general manager successions in multinational enterprise subsidiaries -- This study examines the dynamics of general manager (GM) succession in the foreign subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs). First, drawing on insights from evolutionary theory and the organizational learning literature, we argue that MNEs are adaptive organizations such that prior subsidiary GM changes at the “intra” regional level decrease the probability of further GM change in the focal subsidiary. Our logic is that the accumulated context-specific knowledge may allow MNEs to further develop extant succession routines. Second, in the context at the “inter” regional level, given the high spatial transaction costs, what are more likely to be applied to the focal subsidiary are standardized succession processes, which are less likely to accommodate the situations specific to the focal subsidiary. Due to the reduced marginal costs of making similar changes, prior GM successions that occurred outside the region where the focal subsidiary operates accelerate the momentum for further GM change in this subsidiary. Third, we propose that when changing from a parent-country national to a host-country national GM, succession routines may be refined in order to accommodate particular candidates or particular search committees, which in turn decelerates the momentum for further subsidiary GM change. A fixed effects longitudinal analysis of 1,169 Japanese subsidiary firms between 1995 and 2013 provides empirical evidence to support these arguments."
19929,"Innovating beyond: Social innovation as extra-organizational innovation -- Today’s grand challenges call for innovations that enhance societal problem solving. Such innovations unlike conventional “organizational innovation” are not exclusively meant to improve innovators’ position in the marketplace through increasing customer satisfaction. Instead, the innovations need to (1) incorporate action on different levels of society, including policy or public discourse, and (2) address and involve a broader range of actors to lead to improved social outcomes. Social innovation is a prototype of such “extra-organizational innovation”. I use microfinance as a prime example of social innovation to theorize it as extra-organizational innovation by means of Giddens’ structuration theory. I develop a theoretical model and research propositions on innovation (a) mechanisms, (b) actors, and (c) effects that highlight how social innovation is systematically different from organizational innovation. I extend my theorizing to how structuration can help understand other new types of innovation that can be considered extra-organizational on at least one of the two accounts, the magnitude of actors or the multitude of levels of action involved. These types include open innovation, entrepreneurship as method and institutional innovation."
19931,"A Strategy-as-Practice Perspective on Stakeholder Management -- Stakeholder management is part of the day-to-day activities of managers. Yet, we currently know much more about stakeholder management outcomes than how managers actually consider and balance stakeholder needs. Drawing on an inductive analysis of mixed-methods data from 353 Dutch philanthropic organizations, this paper unpacks the practice of stakeholder management. Informed by a strategy-as-practice lens, which has fruitfully advanced other branches of strategy research, it unpacks what stakeholder management practices look like, how and why managers enact them, and the consequences for stakeholders in terms of prioritization versus harmonization of their needs. We contribute to stakeholder theory by developing a new descriptive and empirically informed understanding of how managers deal with stakeholder demands. By identifying distinct ways in which managers deal with stakeholders, while moving beyond opposite cultural or moral pre-configurations as the foundational explanation, we take important steps towards explaining variation within as well as across stakeholder management approaches."
19945,"Burning the Bridges: Authenticity, Innovation and Transgression in Norwegian Black Metal -- This study explores the dark side of an inherently positive construct - authenticity. Posing conformity (reproducing essential features) and differentiation (asserting distinctive features) as alternative routes to achieving authenticity, we document the escalation of the latter into normative violation. Escalation is the refusal of compromise as a way of reducing the gap between private self and public display. The research context is Norwegian black metal, unprecedented in music history in elevating extremity to a core principle of construction of artistic and collective identities. We examine two forms of escalation - as innovation in music and transgression (i.e. church burnings). Escalation was mediated through the exclusion and self-exclusion of actors with lower tolerance for extremity. Its substantive importance is in adding a layer of complexity to evaluation. That black metal’s connection to crime has contributed to its endurance suggests that escalating action defying normative scripts can be attributed authenticity when interpreted as sincere and consistent embodiment of alternative values. We paint a large canvass of the escalation process by drawing on examples in history, fiction and politics."
19947,"Off the Beaten Path: Asocial Exploration in Managerial Decision-making -- The process of search focuses on identifying new solutions. When we define a new solution as a choice that an individual has not yet identified as a viable alternative, novelty may be derived from two fundamentally distinct processes: either from search undertaken in isolation from others or from the adoption of solutions that others have already explored. We refer to the former process of search as asocial exploration and to the latter as social exploration. In our experimental study, we examine the behavior of individuals who are given the opportunity to choose between social and asocial exploration, in the face of failure. After reporting on the relative levels of these two forms of search, we seek to identify conditions within the social environment that can elevate individuals’ propensity to engage in asocial exploration. Our focus is on evaluations of choices that result in negative outcomes. We find that, under conditions of failure, asocial exploration is greater when individuals receive positive evaluations of past choices. We also find that this pattern is particularly pronounced among highly narcissistic managers."
19948,"Standing on the shoulders of giants: How star scientists influence their co-authors -- Despite prior research that supports the link between collaborations with star scientists and their co-workers’ productivity, empirical findings on this relationship are surprisingly mixed. To address this, we theorize and empirically disentangle two mechanisms through which star peer effects can occur: a collaboration can convey a direct peer effect by acting as a pipe, through which ideas and knowledge are conveyed from a star to her co-workers, or an indirect peer effect by acting as a prism, meaning that a collaboration with a star signals the quality of her collaborators’ work to others. To investigate this, we examine the effect of collaborating on scientific publications with a star who either won, or was nominated for but did not win, the Nobel Prize in Physics. We use the death of a star to isolate pipes and do not find that the co-authors of Nobel Prize winners publish fewer articles than the co-authors of Nobel Prize nominees. Isolating prisms, we find that the articles of the co-authors of Nobel Prize winners that were published prior to the focal co-author’s first collaboration with the winner receive a citation boost after the Nobel Prize is awarded, relative to the co-authors of Nobel Prize nominees. Using an innovative measure of the recognition of pioneering research, we find that this difference in citations causes articles written by the co-authors of Nobel Prize nominees to experience a delay in recognition. Our results clarify how stars contribute to their co-workers’ productivity and provide evidence of the benefits that can arise from indirect peer effects."
19979,"Social Attribution of Collaborative Outcomes: A Study of Status Dynamics in Jazz Music Industry -- This study examines how social recognition of collaborative outcomes affects status gain of actors. While research on status dynamics suggests that actors may enhance their status by producing desirable outcomes or by collaborating with high-status actors, understanding the influence of collaborative outcomes is problematic because actors in a collaborative relationship take varying status positions and gain only partial credit for their collaborative outcomes. Drawing from attribution theory, we suggest that while desirable outcomes and collaborating with higher-status actors tend to increase a focal actor’s status individually, collaborations with higher-status actors result in gaining less credit for the desirable outcomes because audiences tend to attribute the desirable outcomes more to the higher-status collaborators and less to the lower-status actor. Analyzing collaboration networks among jazz musicians between 1950 and 2004, we found the negative moderation effect of collaborator status on gaining status from desirable collaborative outcomes; musicians gain less status from receiving positive ratings from critics and from creating novel repertoires when they collaborate with actors who have higher status than them. This finding highlights the audiences’ credit allocation to the contributors in status evaluation and reveals underexplored processes in status dynamics."
19995,"Toward a Dynamic Perspective on Organizational Authenticity -- Prior research has investigated organizational authenticity by considering the underlying consistency between internal values and external expressions as persistent and static, thus neglecting its temporal dimension. In this study, we provide a richer consideration of the processual nature of organizational authenticity, through an empirical investigation of how it evolves over time. We do so by conducting an in-depth qualitative case study of Masi Agricola, a seventh-generation family-owned Italian wine producer. Our analysis revealed that, when facing episodes of authenticity struggle, the organization experienced a first phase of authenticity drifting, including those actions that underpinned the perception of inconsistency between values and practices and the organization displaying such discrepancy. This was critical to facilitate the organizational reaction, ensuing a new phase of authenticity grafting to establish new links of consistency. Our findings and theoretical insights advance the current understanding of the temporal dimension of organizational authenticity, challenging the prevailing view of a linear process of authenticity restoration, and providing new insights on the dichotomy between consistency and inconsistency as an instrumental dynamic in connecting values with practices."
20055,"Deliberate vs. spontaneous networking behaviors and information search: An interactive experiment -- While networking is frequently characterized in terms of dichotomous sets of behaviors, little is known about how individuals find a balance between them. This omission is especially striking in contexts where these dichotomies present themselves as trade-offs, forcing networking individuals to choose between opposing types of behaviors. Networking events are a prime example of such a context, as participants are concurrently searching for information and act as targets of others’ search efforts. We focus on two of the dichotomies that are most relevant in such social context – deliberate versus spontaneous as well as selfish versus altruistic networking – to examine how and why individuals respond differently to these trade-offs, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the observed approaches. We do so by way of an interactive networking experiment, which includes random assignment into treatment groups of varying levels of background knowledge, as well as real-time tracking of participants’ movement using sociometric badges. Our results allow us to differentiate between two routes taken by networking participants: a direct, deliberate and selfish one of information exploitation, and an indirect, spontaneous and altruistic one of information gathering, both of which may be understood as integral parts of the same cyclical process. We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of our study."
20084,"Trust can blind and distrust can aid: Watchful blindness under interpartner uncertainty -- Although studies on trust as an organizing principle have advanced our understanding of organizing in the context of interdependency and uncertainty, research has not yet explored the distinct roles of trust and distrust, and how they simultaneously, and synergistically affect interorganizational interactions under interpartner uncertainty. We enrich the theorizing based on a case study of the Swedish robotics and automation ecosystem where interpartner uncertainty—due to complex interdependencies, frequent coopetitive interactions, and temporal alignment of actors in multiple projects—is a key organizing challenge. We identify distinct orienting and enabling mechanisms of trust and distrust respectively, which both individually and synergistically support firms in maintaining fruitful interactions in the face of uncertainty. Furthermore, we integrate the mechanisms of trust and distrust into a model explaining how trust and distrust as organizing principles interact to give rise to watchful blindness."
20119,"Inception point: Combining institutional complexity and strategy-as-practice for strategizing -- This paper examines the intersection between institutional theory and strategy, and more specifically, institutional complexity and strategy-as-practice, to further our understanding of how organizations can effectively respond to multiple, and often conflicting, institutional pressures. We present an in-depth case study of a UK-headquartered commercial law firm, documenting how the firm has navigated the ongoing shift from a once traditional legal field dominated by the professional logic, to a more fluid situation, characterized by the increasing encroachment of the market logic. Our study brings together the macro approach of institutional complexity and the micro processes of strategy to offer multiple contributions. In particular, we further current literature on organizational strategic responses by showing that multiple strategies can co-exist within one firm at a given time, and we highlight the potential of talk as a medium through which organizational response strategies are initially brought into being."
20238,"Filling the Void: How Occupational Authority Emerges from Curating Learning Algorithms -- The data-driven, statistical, and opaque nature of learning algorithms makes them distinct from previous technologies. They are speculated to be consequential for work and organizing, but how they are reconfiguring work practices is not yet fully understood. Building on a 31-month ethnographic study of predictive policing, a learning algorithm to predict crime chances, we find that its implementation was associated with the unexpected growth in authority of an occupational group (“intelligence officers”). Our process analysis finds that this change in authority was triggered by the knowledge gap that emerged between the algorithmic outputs and the police work domain. Because intelligence officers could not open the blackboxed algorithm, they instead tried to bridge the knowledge gap by means of “algorithmic curation” practices, thereby offering their own predictions and backgrounding the learning algorithm. This approach to “fill the void” reinforced the knowledge gap and kept management assuming that the predictions were made by the algorithm, which increased the authority of intelligence officers over police work allocation. Our findings offer contributions to the emerging literature on the influence of algorithmic technology on work and to the literature on occupational authority. Next to this, we provide insights into studying learning algorithms in practice."
20380,"Inside the stigma panzer: Organizational members’ emotional work in response to organizational event -- We investigate how organizational members manage their emotional experiences of organizational event stigma as an implication of organizational wrongdoing. Our research is based on a longitudinal case study of Best Bank, that has been involved in a money laundering scandal of historical magnitude. Our study of organizational members shows how their pride and organizational loyalty makes them develop a ‘stigma panzer’, i.e. a number of emotional responses when at work as well as at home, that serves to protect them against the negative implications of the event stigmatization. We show how the stigma panzer may benefit the individual employee facing the event stigma at work, while we question if this emotional stigma panzer at home is also beneficial for the organization. We conclude by calling for more stigma research to understand better the implications of emotions at work and at home for organizational stigma related to organizational wrongdoing."
20409,"Lonely At The Top? CEO Sensemaking In The Boardroom -- Amidst the uncertainty and ambiguity characterizing CEO’s role, issues or events that are “novel, ambiguous, confusing, or in some other way violate expectations” (Maitlis & Christianson, 2014: 57) mobilize CEOs to seek information and to challenge their - and others’ - understanding. Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with 146 global CEOs, we conduct a micro-level analysis of how CEOs seek, process and make sense of information via their interactions with the TMT and others as part of their decision-making process. We explore the interchangeable and power-charged process of sensedemanding and sensemaking through which meaning-making and eventually decision-making occur. The process involves CEOs (nominally) conceding some of their power and voice to others, before retaining them prior to making a decision. CEOs invite dissension and hence, also invite multivocality (and as a result also equivocality) from their environment and seek to test or validate sensemaking and crystalize it into decisions. Our findings unpack the micro-dynamics of CEO decision-making drawing on the CEO-TMT interface, managerial cognition and decision-making literatures."
20467,"Settle Down or the Struggle Within: A Multiple Case-Study of Organizational Character Development -- Using a multiple-case study of two financial services firms in the Netherlands, we explain how organizational character develops when new commitments are articulated and extant commitments are maintained. We found that commitments become expressed as a result of the perceived organizational past, envisioned organizational future, and as a result of pressure from internal subgroups. Because these commitments were made salient to managers, tensions became manifest, leading to various forms of struggle. Four interrelated dynamics underlie this state of struggle, which we termed emerging dilemmas, organizational identity clarity, ambiguous or superficial commitments and structural differentiation. In such context, the enactment of three stabilizing practices, specifically, substantive integrative work, routinizing a collective conscience and leaders’ modeling behaviors, contributed to commitment affirmation or commitment violation, providing the opportunity for further anchoring these commitments in organizational character. In elaborating theory around these actions, we contribute to scholarly and practitioners understanding around how organizations may improve in embedding contradictory commitments within organizational boundaries and rejuvenate the study of organizations as value-infused social actors."
20549,"Organizational Failure as a Value Judgement: A Review and Reconceptualization -- While organizational failure has been a central concept in the broader Management field for some time, the question of how to conceptualize organizational failure remains widely debated. We review previous reconceptualizations of organizational failure, and subsequently propose to conceptualize failure as a value judgement. As a value judgement, we argue, fail-ure is a relational concept of the fifth degree. This means that organizational failure is related to (a) the state of an organization, (b) somebody who assesses the situation, (c) with regard to certain aspects, (d) specific circumstances, and (e) in view of a goal. This reconceptualization shifts the discourse on failure from considering it as a state of an organization (e.g., insolven-cy, bankruptcy), or an event (e.g., closure, termination, cessation) (i.e., ontological concepts) towards studying organizational failure as a value judgement (i.e., axiological concept). Conceptualizing failure as a value judgement helps to differentiate failure from related concepts such as organizational decline, organizational error and others."
20553,"Categorization and Organizational Evolution: A Species Approach to Organizational Form -- Organizational evolution has become a keystone of wider organizational sciences as it seeks to understand the emergence and sustained presence of organizational forms within the econosystem. Rooted in a population ecology approach to evolutionary theory, the field is presented with the key issue of how to draw the boundaries between organizational forms and thus delimit populations. Despite this centrality, development of a cogent classificatory scheme that meets the demands of both the philosophy of science and social ontology has been elusive. In this paper I integrate the concept of natural kinds taken from philosophy of science with allegory to the ecological niche to formulate an Organizational Species Concept which accommodates these demands. I operationalize this framework through cluster analysis and an abductive process of exploratory science. This is applied to a unique national data set covering an emergent organizational form in food systems, the “food hub”, as a proof of concept. This application carries policy import for goals that center food hubs within initiatives to scale up local and regional food systems. Through this application, I show how determinations about organizational form and underlying populations can be made."
20587,"Imprinting Risky Behavior: The Institutional Origins of Bank CEO Risk-Taking -- Commercial banks in the United States have taken on more risk since the 1980s, in line with a shift in the dominant business model in the field, from one emphasizing financial stability to one promoting greater risk-taking to maximize shareholder value. But why did certain banks embrace risky strategies more actively than others? Combining insights from the upper echelons perspective and imprinting theory, we argue that bank CEOs who absorbed the principles of shareholder value maximization through MBA education and started their banking career in the post-deregulation era pursued risk-taking more aggressively than other CEOs. We test this argument using data on 194 large commercial banks from 1993 to 2015. Our analysis shows that CEOs with an MBA who entered banking after the mid-1980s were heavier users of brokered deposits—a riskier funding source that contributed to bank instability during the 2007-2009 credit crisis. They also contributed to the use of brokered deposits indirectly by promoting shareholder-value prescriptions known to boost incentives for managerial risk-taking. By highlighting the role that organizational decision-makers—and their institutionally-embedded cognitive orientations—play in driving the uptake of risky strategies, our study contributes to the literatures on corporate risk-taking and institutional change."
20662,"Auto-tuned and R-Squared: Quality Evaluations and Organizing Creativity -- While navigating the subjective and differing quality evaluations of a range of actors has been identified as a fundamental feature of creative processes, how audience perceptions of quality are navigated in the creative process remains under-theorized. We examine this question through a comparative ethnography of two settings where big data brings audience quality evaluations to the fore—Nashville music production and systems biology cancer research. We find that actors encounter a fundamental tension between the perfection and authenticity of creative outcomes that manifests in two competing standards of quality: the raw, empirically grounded, and authentic versus the technically processed, improved and refined. We show how these standards are negotiated vis-a-vis three different audiences – internal peers, extended community, and external reviewers – and identify implications for the literatures on collective creativity as well as audience evaluations."
20780,"Competing for Good? Conceptualizing how Social Enterprises Categorize and Respond to One Another -- Although there is a sizable literature on how organizations strategically respond to similar organizations, it is unclear how many of the associated prescriptions apply in the context of social enterprise, given these organizations’ focus on creating social value and assumptions of their cooperative propensity. Through a qualitative study of 46 leaders in the second-hand textiles market we surface a model of categorization in this setting that exposes how and why moral distinctions between organizations get noticed and thus encourage a broader set of inter-organizational responses. Our findings and model extend theory regarding how strategic managers form mental models of their competitive landscape, illustrating that rivalry does not merely entail attempts to appropriate value and generate competitive advantage but also political efforts involving collective identity maintenance."
20801,"Organizational risk-taking in the context of ambiguity -- How do firms adjust their exposure to local market risks when those risks suddenly become ambiguous? Behavioral theories of risk-taking (e.g. Audia and Greve 2006, March and Shapira 1992) offer little guidance. They implicitly assume that the interpretations of organizational performance problems that trigger changes in risk-taking are unambiguous. This paper argues that firms that are confronted with ambiguity produced by rare shocks ignore historic performance feedback when adjusting their risk exposure to the affected region. Instead, firms rely on firm-wide insolvency thresholds, local social performance comparisons, and local market signals to guide their risk adjustments. The statistical analysis of an original panel dataset of homeowner insurance underwriting behavior in the U.S. between 1992 and 2012 supports this argument. Critically, however, it also demonstrates that a greater reliance on social learning in such circumstance is contingent on the unavailability of legitimatized means of forecasting future risk exposure. The institutionalization of hurricane forecasting models in insurance markets reduced reliance on such social learning and directly altered risk-taking. The paper contributes to efforts to better understand the scope condition and dynamics of problemistic search and learning processes and their impact on organizational risk-taking and adaptive behavior."
20830,"Distinctiveness through categories: Generalization and the exploration of novel options -- Understanding how novel ideas are evaluated and recognized is important for organizational prosperity. A systematic evaluative bias against novel options after a negative experience - known as the ‘hot stove effect’ - may prevent organizations from engaging in enough explorations to identify novel ideas. We show that the adverse consequences of the hot-stove effect can be reduced by manipulating how novel options are categorized. The core of our mechanism is that categorization of options in more categories reduces the generalization of negative experience to other options, whereas categorization in fewer options favors such generalization. We develop predictions based on a computational model and test these in a behavioral experiment (N=302). The task environment is a setting in which participants decide between a known ‘status quo’ option and six unknown, novel options. Participants are randomly allocated into three conditions that vary in terms of the number of categories to which the novel options belong. If the six novel options belong to six distinct categories, the propensity to explore is significantly higher than when options belong to fewer categories. When all novel options belong to the same category, participant are most likely to avoid exploration. Our findings suggests new ways managers could favor, or prevent, exploration of novel options by organizational members."
20860,"The boiled frog in organizational learning: Sensing, adapting to and surviving environmental change -- Radical change in a firm’s environment is often viewed as discontinuous. We introduce the concept of continuous radical change by which old beliefs are rendered fallacious at an incremental pace. We theorize that incremental change can be as harmful as discontinuous change because it can remain undetected for too long by incumbent organizations. Specifically, we argue for a curvilinear relationship between the pace of environmental change and the organizational lifespan. We test out predictions using data from some 31,000 restaurants in the New York City Metropolitan area between the years 2007-2018. We use a fixed effects regression model to test for differences in the lifespan of restaurants located in areas of slow but radical gentrification versus those located in areas with accelerated and radical gentrification. We find support for an inverted U-shape between the pace of gentrification and restaurant lifespan. We explore whether this relationship is driven by differences in restaurants’ adaptation behavior."
20889,"Clean your desk! Dressage and activity-based working in a French banking organization -- As part of popular new kinds of activity-based working, many companies seek to implement so-called clean-desk policies, in which users have to empty their desk after completing a task, so that other workers can feel free to use this desk. Following Henri Lefebvre’s discussion of ‘Dressage’ in the context of Rhytm-analysis (Lefebvre 2004 [1992]), we argue that clean desk policies are part of a wider organizational strategy in flexibilizing working practices, focusing on the performative management of bodily and material aspects of work demonstrating control over these aspects. In drawing on a case study of a French Bank, which introduced a flexible working environment in 2016-2018, and following Lefebvre’s ideas, we argue that and how dressage can be understood as a separate but key component in the domination and embodiment of flexiblized work practices."
20908,"Shared values and social value creation in a nascent organization -- We address a central gap in our understanding of social entrepreneurship by scrutinizing the processes through which nascent organizations create social innovation—new practices that create social value to beneficiaries. More specifically, our study examines the role that shared values play in a nascent social organization’s efforts to conceive, develop, and deliver social value. Our inductive analysis highlights how the purported social value emerged from organizational leadership’s initial vision that committed the organization to provide specific value to beneficiaries that motivated the development of related organizational practices. Initially, members of the organization formed negative value judgments, as they perceived the practices and outcomes to be misaligned with members’ salient values. Members’ judgments concerning social and private value shifted despite organizational practices remaining largely unchanged, as their salient shared values shifted from other-directed caring to reciprocal communality and personal archievement. Our study contributes by theorizing social value and elaborating how shared values amongst organizational members influence how social organizations develop."
20909,"Boundary work and contextual demands: Micro-strategies in interprofessional collaboration -- Research on boundary work in the context of professions has studied how professional groups and their members engage in actions to expand or defend their profession’s jurisdiction. We argue that individual professionals not only engage in boundary work for reasons serving the professional group as a whole, but also in consequence of the very plain contextual demands of individuals that arise from their everyday work. Drawing on prior research on professionals’ boundary work and taking a micro-lens on interprofessional collaboration (IPC), we investigate the micro-strategies of individual professionals in IPC when faced with contextual demands that lead to conflicting subgoals. To do so, we build on fieldwork in German nursing homes, analyzing IPC between geriatric nurses (GNs) and general practitioners (GPs) that is strongly determined by differing contextual demands and subgoals. Our findings show a broad scope of micro-level strategies that GPs and GNs deploy when dealing with contextual demands at the boundary. Furthermore, we show how power and trust are core determinants of these micro-strategies, and develop a comprehensive theoretical framework on micro-level boundary work under conditions of contextual demands."
20945,"Beyond Vision Clarity: It Takes Trust to Listen to the Team -- At the heart of effective team communication there lies the clarity of team vision. It allows team members to listen with the expectation to move the team forward towards its goal. However, the mechanisms through which vision clarity translates into team listening are largely uncharted. In this study we developed a model that investigates the role of team trust and commitment in the relationship between team vision clarity and team action listening. Using the data collected from 474 members of 100 teams throughout a five-year quantitative study we show that the clarity of team vision is not enough in establishing effective team listening. It requires team members to have relational bonds such as trust to be receptive to the clarity of the team vision and demonstrate that they actually listen to what is being discussed in the team. We argue that this is because team listening extends beyond commonly researched practices of active listening, transcending the traditional verbal and non-verbal feedback. It relies on the actions taken as responses to team discussions that demonstrate to the team members that they are being listened. In trusting teams team members demonstrate that they listen to one another by taking action – team action listening."
20946,"From Shelter to Emancipation: How Disabled Workers Found Their Own Voice Through Identity Work -- While studies have examined individual and organizational identity work, we focus on the dynamic interplay between the two. Drawing on a six-year longitudinal study of disabled workers in a sheltered workshop in Germany, we show how the disabled found their own voice to be seen as active members of society and changed the organizational exclusionary identity of the workshop. We develop a process model with three different phases of “guided emancipation:” maintenance of identity constraints, external validation, and forging a new disability identity. Our findings advance our understanding of individual and organizational identity work processes in the workplace. First, engagement in purposeful identity work is not just performed by managers and leaders, but also by marginalized actors to empower themselves in an organization in which their role is highly constrained. Second, by illustrating the dynamic interplay between both individual and organizational identity work, we show how changes in individual identity work can precipitate an overall change in organizational identity. Third, we show how disabled workers engaged in identity work to change the socially constructed view of disability imposed on them by sheltered workshops as part of an institutionalized welfare system through expressing a positive disability identity based on their self-concept."
20991,"Negotiating Provisional Role Structures in the Shadow of Hierarchies -- Emergent coordination has been studied primarily in environments where generalized role structures and occupational communities are well-established. How individuals coordinate work in less-institutionalized or more rapidly-changing environments is less understood. I use a combination of participant observation and interview data collected in a medium-sized startup, GuestInn, to develop theory about the ways that people coordinate work when roles are more ambiguous. GuestInn management uses an institution, locally referred to as ""ownership,"" to foster commitment in employees. Lacking developed role relations, employees of GuestInn continually negotiate provisional role relations for coordinated work using the same institution, ""ownership."" The analysis contributes to our understanding of emergent coordination by showing how it works when role structures are less developed. It also refines our understanding of normative control to consider how it shapes employee-employee coordination. It also refine theory on the role of formal hierarchies in organizations with distributed authority rights: people's ability to negotiate lateral coordination without deep shared understanding of one another's work is facilitated by the shadow cast by vertical membership rights over negotiations, without directly involving nominal superordinates. Finally, I introduce the concept of generalized authority rights to describe authority rights that are decoupled from official position and nominally granted to all employees."
21042,"The Paradox of Network Intervention: Exploring the Consequences of Policies for Promoting Connection -- Social networks are everywhere, but until recently, the particularities of the structures were seldom remarked upon outside academia. Today, however, policymakers and managers are becoming more aware both of how networks are structured and how those structures create opportunities and constraints. Consequently, network interventions—deliberate efforts to shape a network configuration—are increasingly common. Nevertheless, researchers have devoted little systematic attention to them. We take a first step towards building systematic understanding of network interventions by examining the relationship between the structure of existing networks in targeted groups and responsiveness to network interventions. Specifically, we theorize that groups with greater fragmentation are less likely to engage with incentive-based network interventions and conditional on engaging, the interventions are less likely to be effective at transforming the network. To evaluate these ideas, we conducted a study of accountable care organizations. Our approach leveraged data on 100 million patient sharing relationships millions of providers in 3,000 communities across the United States. Additionally, we used several instruments to better identify the proposed relationships, including the Medicaid expansion and local political environments. Our results reveal a network intervention paradox—groups that may benefit most from such interventions appear least equipped to respond positively to them."
21051,"Going it alone or partnering? Collaboration, visibility and quality in the video game industry -- This paper proposes a role theoretic approach of inter-organizational collaboration in cultural industries. Complementing traditional resource-based arguments with identity considerations, we explore how the separation or consolidation of production and distribution roles affects the visibility and quality ratings of cultural products. We contend that roles primarily serve two functions in cultural industries. First, they grant access to resources. When roles are separated, each organization can access specialized resources and use them to target a different audience. Thus, products resulting from role separation are more visible than those launched by integrated creative producers or integrated distributors. Second, roles provide a basis for social categorization, and determine the criteria used by audience members to evaluate products. Role consolidation provides unambiguous evaluation cues, whereas role separation engenders ambiguous identity expectations. Thus, products resulting from role consolidation are characterized by higherratings. We test our hypotheses using a novel dataset of video games launched globally between 1980 and 2011. We complement these results with field interviews, drawing implications for the division of labor in cultural industries in the digital era."
21061,"Stand up or stand by: The effects of network positions on whistle-blowing -- This paper examines which network positions enable individuals to engage in whistle-blowing in a context of sexual harassment in Hollywood movie industry. We hypothesize that individuals who are in an open network are more likely to engage in whistle-blowing. This is because they can get access to variety of information regarding the level of retaliation by sexual harasser and supporters of their whistle-blowing. We also hypothesize that high-status individuals are more likely to engage in whistle-blowing. This is because they can control relevant resources such as information and connections. Also, they can ask low-status actors to support their whistle-blowing when they form a tie with low-status ones. We test our hypotheses on the Hollywood film industry and find support for our hypotheses that different network positions determine whistle-blowing."
21070,"An Agenda-Setting Model of Stakeholder Influence -- Existing research has shown that when multiple demands from stakeholder activists are directed at a firm in a sequential manner, the multiple demands build on each other to magnify activist pressure and thereby enhance activists’ capacity to influence firm outcomes. However, in many instances, multiple demands from stakeholder activists are not directed at a firm sequentially, but simultaneously. Yet, when multiple activist demands are directed at the same firm at the same time, these demands compete for attention from decision makers in the firm and risk crowding each other out, thereby hampering the ability of any individual activist demand to influence firm outcomes. Building on this premise, we propose an agenda setting model of stakeholder influence where multiple activist demands compete for space on the agenda of decision makers in firms. To test this model, we look at the shareholder proposal process in the United States and specifically examine the shareholder proposal campaign between 2006 and 2010 for the introduction of Say on Pay – a corporate governance policy that consists in submitting a firm’s executive compensation plan to a vote from shareholders. Consistent with the crowding out hypothesis, we find that Say on Pay proposals were more effective when firms received fewer shareholder proposals on other issues in the same year. And once adopted as part of the regular agenda of the annual meeting, Say on Pay was more effective at curbing CEO compensation when firms received fewer shareholder proposals on other issues in the same year."
21130,"What the WUNC? Perceptions of WUNC and Social Movement Mobilization -- Charles Tilly (1994) provided a four-part framework that outsiders (e.g., targets, potential supporters) use when assessing a social movement: worthiness, unity, numbers, and commitment (WUNC). These attributes have been embraced, sometimes implicitly, by most scholars of movement recruitment and mobilization. However, this measure has never been explicitly tested as an evaluative schema used by outsiders in making mobilization decisions. Here, we first develop a measure designed to assess the four factors of the WUNC theory (N = 539). We then use this measure to test how individual variation in this evaluative schema predict actual social movement donation behavior (N = 361). Finally, we consider how movements make identity claims around (1) the issues they focus on and (2) the diversity of the movement's participants affect WUNC and subsequent mobilization attempts (N = 380)."
21148,"Two Experts Are Better Than One: Reaping the Rewards of Specialization Through Better Communication -- The successful management of firm knowledge ensures that useful consumer knowledge is communicated effectively to inform product design decisions. This study analyzes how the use of a common organizational language can enhance communication between a marketing analyst and a product engineer. The use of a common language is shown to increase the probability of knowledge transfer; however, its dependence on learning effort from both parties makes it beneficial only when the cost of learning is not too high and each party can capture an adequate share of the firm's value. Distortions arise when the engineer, initially uncertain about the demand for its own product design, must determine the mode of communication with the marketing analyst to obtain information on consumer preferences. If the engineer is given the power to choose whether to implement a common language system and how much equity to allocate to the marketing analyst, the common language will be both under-used and under-exploited when it is adopted. The deviation of the engineer's actions from the firm optimal decision has managerial implications for the role of intermediation to resolve communication issues between disparate parties within an organization."
21151,"From exception to exceptional: How gender and tenure impact sponsor effectiveness -- The important role that referrals play in the hiring process, particularly for those contending with negative stereotypes and biases, is well documented in the literature. However, how these negative stereotypes and biases impact the efficacy of individuals providing referrals (i.e., sponsors) is largely missing from prior work, overlooking the additional effects that characteristics of the sponsors can have on the candidate’s (i.e., sponsees) outcomes. We take a multi-methods approach and provide evidence for differences in male and female sponsors’ efficacy, such that greater tenure increases the effectiveness of female sponsors but not male sponsors. Study 1 uses archival data on the U.S. Supreme Court law clerkship hiring process and provides initial evidence that sponsor gender and tenure interact to influence the probability of the sponsee being selected for a top-tier position. Study 2 replicates and extends these findings in an experimental setting and provides evidence for a causal relationship between sponsor gender and sponsor effectiveness. This study shows greater tenure confers credibility to female sponsors and this, in turn, increases female sponsors’ effectiveness, but that great tenure does not influence male sponsors’ efficacy."
21166,"Managing the Identity-Size Paradox in Platforms: The Case of Platform Cooperatives -- Platform organizations operate between two different competition logics: winner-takes-all, which prioritizes platform size, and distinctiveness logic, which prioritizes platform identity as a strategic dimension. While the platform strategy literature has primarily focused on the former, outlining ways to quickly grow the network of users and complementors, it has largely ignored platform identity. A key challenge for platforms is, however, to manage tensions that arise when both size and identity constraints are present. To explore how strategic tensions between platform size and platform identity are manifested and what platforms do to address them, we employ a multi-case study of platform cooperatives – an organizational form that commences from a distinctiveness logic. We find that platform cooperatives deal with several size-identity tensions as they go through three core phases: (1) enacting identity as a vehicle for growth; (2) diluting identity to enable growth; (3) growth-enabled identity redefinition. Moving across these phases, we identify the underlying strategic activities that platforms use to navigate what we termed as the ‘identity-size paradox’. Overall, we contribute to the literature on multi-sided platforms, and particularly in regards to platform strategy, as well as to the broader platform economy literature. Keywords: platform strategy, new organizational forms, platform cooperatives, platform identity"
21207,"Everything must change so that everything can stay the same: open access in UK academic publishing -- In this paper, we explore the question of how incumbents can respond to disruptive, existential threats in a way that reinforces their privileged position within a field. We draw on the case of the transition towards open access in the field of academic publishing in the UK. The findings of this study reveal that in spite of the change - from academic production and distribution as ‘closed access’ to ‘open access’ - incumbents respond to the threat of disruption by using socio symbolic strategies. Strategies that incumbents utilized to first influence the institutional pressures they faced and secondly to implement open access practices of distribution in a way that enhanced rather than disrupted their ability to capture value. Therefore, the threat of disruption ends up being an opportunity for the incumbents. Our findings contribute to current theories on organizational theorizing. By identifying the strategies that incumbents used to manage the transition to open access by showing how incumbents not only can maintain their privileged position, but even reinforce it when confronting disruptive institutional pressures, we contribute to conversations of institutional maintenance. We also contribute to theories on technology and institutions: we find that technological discontinuities trigger institutional change as they open up a plethora of potential paths of institutional change which opens up a discursive power struggle amongst field participants in driving the path most aligned with their interests."
21230,"Does Investor Gender Matter? The Signaling Effect of Gender Homophily in Entrepreneurial Finance -- One proposed solution to closing the gender gap in venture capital is to encourage female investors to invest in female entrepreneurs. This paper explores how gender homophily affects the long-term success of male-founded and female-founded firms, defined as the continued ability to raise venture financing. Using longitudinal data on venture-backed firms in the United States and employing matching methods, we find that female-founded firms backed only by female investors are two times less likely to raise additional capital compared to those whose first-round investors include male venture capitalists. We find no equivalent effect for male-founded firms. We propose that when female entrepreneurs receive funding from female investors, the market interprets this as an expression of diversity activism, rather than as a signal of quality. We test this explanation in an experimental setting and show that a female-female investment relationship produces a competence discount for the female entrepreneur, leading to lower evaluations of quality for female, but not male founders."
21268,"Pride Without Prejudice:The Burden of Under-Recognition in Organizations -- Public recognition is a powerful strategic tool for motivating individuals. Yet because high status recognition derives its desirability from scarcity, public recognition inevitably invites social comparisons. Since status recognition commonly corresponds with performance and accompanies tangible rewards, it is challenging to isolate pure social comparison costs. Leveraging a natural experiment in a large multinational organization, I provide novel evidence that employees are distinctly sensitive to status recognition beyond any material, career, or reputation concerns. When denied status recognition, employees are much more likely to exit the organization, despite receiving higher monetary rewards as recompense for nominal under-recognition. This study demonstrates the serious risks of using status recognition as an employee performance motivator. The analysis has broad implications for the strategic decisions organizations face when trying to motivate employees through nonmonetary reward systems."
21301,"Permeability alongside ‘Sense of Community’ in Open Contemporary Work Organization—Coworking-Spaces -- Open, entrepreneurial, and collaboratively organized work forms are proliferating worldwide. A prominent form is coworking-spaces, run by specialized coworking-space providers or incumbent firms. Coworking-spaces host collocated work of individuals, often from diverse professional backgrounds. Initial empirical insights indicate that coworking-spaces portray a sense of community among users and independent professionals. Based on an inductive case study from four distinct coworking-spaces, we introduce permeability an organizational characteristic of open contemporary work in coworking-spaces. Insights from the case study further support to model three levels of permeability: spatial permeability, procedural permeability and relational permeability. We develop mechanisms of how permeability functions and identify outcomes on individual-level (job satisfaction, learning, work efficacy, and innoficacy) and organization-level outcomes (team and project, innovation, and venture performance)."
21472,"Need, merit, and script: how a social enterprise moulded defector entrepreneurship -- Where does a hybrid ideal for social entrepreneurship come from? Existing research’s prevalent focus on the dichotomy between social and commercial logics left unexamined the possibility that the institutional environment for social entrepreneurship may be more complex. There can be multiple logics making the social enterprise generate different types of social values, and there may be distinct logics related to different aspects of its commercial viability. Through 10-month ethnography of a South Korean social enterprise supporting North Korean defectors, we find that hybrid organizing can be embedded in multiple logics that go beyond the traditional social-commercial dichotomy (e.g., social welfare, commercial, entrepreneurship, and national integration logics), and furthermore, responding to different challenges at separate times, a social enterprise may practice varying configurations of multiple logics. By adopting the ‘logics-as-tools’ view, we suggest that each hybrid organizing involves a constant process of specifying, embodying, and recombining multiple logics that pragmatically constitutes a unique hybrid ideal customized for particular organizing contexts."
21528,"Making Sense of Catastrophic Accidents: A Theodicy-Based Framework -- Catastrophic accidents can considerably threaten organizational members’ identification with their organization, and consequently cause their psychological distress. However, no studies have examined the strategies that organizational members use to make sense of such accidents and restore their psychological wellbeing. This paper draws on Weber’s theodicy concept, which reconciles the conflict between sacred and profane, to examine how organizational members sensemaking strategies. We combine an interpretive analysis of accounts by NASA employees following three fatal organizational accidents with a goal of creating a generalizable sensemaking framework, illustrating the utility of Weber’s theodicy concept to our understanding of how organizational members make sense of accidents. Our analysis reveals extensive use of theodicy logics to explain these accidents."
21695,"Virtue Transfer: Shedding Core-Stigma in The Canadian Wild Fur Industry -- This paper contributes to the stigma management literature by examining the viability of stigma-challenge strategies in mature, harm-based industries – contexts characterized by intense public scrutiny and threats to the continued survival of the category. Drawing on a case study of the Canadian wild fur industry’s response to anti-fur activism and a possible ban on its products, we show how such intense core-stigmas may be managed via collective action. Based on our findings we develop the concept of virtue transfer to describe a stigma-challenge mechanism whereby a virtuous identity – the positive attributes of a sub-group – is effectively transferred onto an entire industry category, in order to counter core-stigma."
21700,"Unpacking the moral dimensions of crowd-based organizing -- New forms of crowd-based organizations (CBOs) are puzzling for organizational scholars. On one hand, they enable unbounded participation – any individual from the crowd can join – creating the conditions for generative interactions and ongoing change. On the other hand, for an organization to sustain itself, the contributions of multiple actors need to be steered toward a certain direction to tame change and achieve stability. Extant literature insights suggest that CBOs may influence and guide crowd behavior through architectural and governance mechanisms, such as rules of participation and structure of incentives. In this paper, we aim to unpack the moral dimensions of CBOs. We develop the argument that discursive resources, in particular, orders of worth, play a crucial role in soliciting and maintaining the commitment of the crowd. Empirically, we study two CBOs, Quirky and Kickstarter, which mobilized orders of worth to convince crowds to contribute to a greater good through their platforms. We found that through raising and materializing moral claims, CBOs solicited the commitment of the crowd and managed to scale their activities. Yet, despite the early success, the actions of an increasingly diverse crowd put a strain on the process of materialization. Hotly debated controversies reflected deep moral tensions that rendered the commitment of the crowd fragile. By unpacking these controversies and the responses of Quirky and Kickstarter to deal with them, this paper offers new insights into the moral dimensions of crowd-based organizational forms."
21739,"When do Predictions Become Performative? Evidence from Simulation Technologies in Urban Planning -- This paper details a set of mechanisms that led to a novel conception of a precursor to performativity. We do so by drawing on data conducted through a year-long ethnography of urban planning processes in two major metropolitan regions in the United States. The urban planners that we studied employed a computer-based simulation technology specifically designed to make predictions that would facilitate long-term regional plans based on theoretical models of land use and transportation. We theorize that people must believe that a prediction is real for it to enable a performative cycle. We follow this theorizing to show how people come to their beliefs about predictions. When people experience predictions through simulations as granular and immersive they treat them as real. Immersiveness and granularity are not inherent properties of simulation, but rather they are constructed as organizations make decisions about structuring and the behavior of actors inside them. ."
21740,"Shepherding Situational Authority: Dealing with the Paradox of Radical Delegation in Hierarchies -- Managers who wish to empower and delegate authority counter a governance paradox: how to foster proactive judgment and collaboration of employees but maintain adequate control and alignment? Prior literature primarily suggests dealing with the paradox by clearly formalizing the scope of delegated authority to shield employee motivation from managerial interferences and managers for overindulgences of employee discretion. However, the more radical delegation is attempted involving also organizational matters, the more unavoidable the overlap of formal and delegated authority becomes. Utilizing internal discussion forum logs and interviews, I explored the organizational dynamics of formal and delegated authority in three mid-sized software services companies that had principally abandoned traditional manager-subordinate structures for broad employee autonomy but where a handful of top managers remained. I discovered that the studied organizations presented a contrast to scholarship: Employees enjoyed from an a priori undelineated encouragement to drive their own and company matters. Instead of a formalized system, decentralized authority was balanced by cross-mediation of managerial interventions, and, respectively, social scrutiny of managerial involvement. These social practices centered around, what I denote as, an attempt to shepherd situational authority so that what makes sense for the whole and who decides would get to be evaluated situationally rather than based on fixed authority. My findings contribute by extending the current understanding of the radical delegation of authority in companies with formal authority asymmetries."
21769,"The Cyclic Organization of Festivals as Temporary Events: The Critical Role of Spatial Practices -- This paper explores how space and spatial practices are central to organizing complex nomadic festivals, particularly how they enable a small number of organizers to coordinate changing actor multiplicity and place-based temporality. We draw on insights from a longitudinal and inductive study of a moving food festival whereby a multiplicity of parties and growing membership transpired. Our analysis reveals that spatial and material practices of envisioning the overarching space, constructing idiosyncratic spaces, enacting distinctive spatial performances, and cultivating unique place-based experiences enable organizers to address core challenges associated with the diverse multiplicity of actors and the temporality of events. Building on the spatial turn in organization studies, we contribute new insights to the study of festivals, temporary organizing and collective meta-level identities."
21788,"The protracted socio-economic impact of perceived white-collar crime -- While the antecedents, consequences, and management of stigma have been well analyzed, it is less well understood how the double stigma of white collar crime and incarceration impacts upon individuals. We also know less about how individuals respond to such stigma in their attempts to manage the perceived devaluation, prejudice, and discrimination before, during and after their incarceration. Drawing on three waves of semi-structured interview and focus group data with 70 inmates at a federal prison in the United States (US) over a period of 16 months, this paper explores how white-collar inmates are impacted by and think about responding to challenges associated with their perceived stigmatization as incarcerated felons. The paper provides three theoretical insights. First, the perceived unintended consequences of stigma associated with incarceration exceed the intended benefits of incarceration. Second, we show six inter-related strategies that help incarcerated individuals to overcome the negative consequences of perceived stigma: i) rationalizing and educating, ii) selective engagement and disclosure, iii) borrowing credibility and networking, iv) demonstrating ability to contribute, v) reassuring soundness of character, and vi) morphing Identity. Third, we conceptually decouple legal illegitimacy, which is time-bound, from social illegitimacy, which is incessant and creates a vicious cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy. Practically, this leaves us to question whether existing approaches to criminal justice overly stigmatize white collar criminals and result in protracted negative socio-economic consequences."
21793,"Using Semantic Networks to Identify the Meanings of Leadership -- We develop a novel method that integrates techniques from machine learning with canonical concepts from network analysis in order to examine how the meaning of leadership has evolved over time. Using articles in Harvard Business Review from 1990 through 2019, we induce yearly semantic networks comprised of roles structurally equivalent to the role of leader. Such roles, from which leader derives meaning, vary in content from coach and colleague to commander and dictator. Yearly shifts in the structural equivalence of leader to clusters of thematically-linked roles reveals a decline in the degree to which leadership is associated with consultative activities and a corresponding rise in the extent to which a leader is understood to occupy a hierarchical position. Our analyses further reveal that the role of leader comes to eclipse the role of manager, measured through changes in pagerank centrality as well as betweenness centrality over the course of our panel. Implications for new research on leadership, culture, and networks are discussed."
21823,"Designing shared representations for open-ended needs -- While a vast literature examined problem-solving as part of decision making in organizations, little is known about how problems are formulated in the first place. Through an ethnographic study, in this paper, I investigate problem formulation by looking at how architects in an architectural practice handled the early phase of their clients’ projects. This phase required them to operate in an uncertain environment, in the presence of ambiguity and heterogeneity of interests and needs, and lack of clarity about constraints. My findings show that problem formulation was driven by two distinct interrelated sub-processes: expanding and contracting problem-space boundaries while simultaneously structuring participation within those boundaries. Through six different activities – canvassing, expanding cognitive frames, envisioning future self, pillaring, scaffolding alternative futures, and reframing – architects managed the process iteratively by continuously altering the problem space boundaries and structuring participation, thus allowing a shared representation of the problem to emerge. My findings challenge the way we think about problems and extend our understanding of problem-solving process beyond the prevalent problem-solution dichotomy. This study contributes to the growing literature that sees problems as catalysts for future value creation by offering empirical evidence and new theoretical insights on how problems are formulated."
21955,"Narrating Value: How Peripheral Functions Prove Their Worth to Organizations -- Dominant narratives of value within organizations have labeled a group of organizational functions as “staff,” “back-office,” or “peripheral.” A common thread uniting these functions is a focus on compliance. These peripheral compliance functions, commonly viewed as indirect contributors to value or even adversaries to value, often struggle with a lack of authority or an inability to transform authority into influence. In this paper, I utilize an ethnographic study of peripheral Environmental Health and Safety professionals to show how these professionals constructed and enacted their own narratives to push back against dominant narratives of value. First, these functions minimized the disruptions caused by compliance, reversing negative perceptions of these functions as overseers or regulatory police, promoting instead a client service relationship. Second, these functions moved beyond compliance to highlight the important issues underlying regulations. These issues directly connected to how the organization generated value. In this way, these peripheral professionals established themselves as collaborators in core work, showing that their work was part of core work, not peripheral to it. This narrative approach to displaying value addresses the issues driving the divide between peripheral and core functions, thereby providing a more general strategy and platform for peripheral functions to address the challenges they face in organizations. This approach also enables organizations to better recognize and capture the value offered by peripheral functions."
22186,"Wait before you learn -- How Organizational Structure shapes Learning Paths -- Hierarchical structures -- here understood as the intra-organizational arrangement of lines of authority, information flows and roles of organizational members -- have been traditionally assumed to inhibit organizational learning and impede an organization's adaptability. We revisit this assumption, which is based on the logic that hierarchies may hinder the accurate processing and delay the internal forwarding of performance feedback, thereby foregoing the opportunity to learn and quickly adapt behavior in a way that increases performance. We argue that this logic is incomplete. A delay in feedback forwarding may also influence the characteristics of the learning process, in particular the search paths and focus of exploratory activities. Employing a simulation model, we examine how organizations search and experiment with new solutions when performance feedback on past actions is delayed and ambiguous. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis uncovers mechanisms of deeper exploration by which hierarchical structures may improve, rather than impede learning and performance improvements in the long run. Our model shows that hierarchies both influence the speed of interpreting and learning from performance feedback as well as the search paths taken to explore alternatives."
22204,"Creativity: the interplay of structural and individual characteristics -- In this study, I examine creativity (i.e. experts’ consensus over novelty of production) as the result of interplay between individual background and structural properties. More precisely, I try to investigate whether and how network positions interact with individual focus to determine creativity. The findings of the study will indicate, for example, whether a filmmaker who can broker ideas of other film professionals is most creative when focused on a specific genre (Western) or role (directing). I contend that while network position reveals (or constrains) opportunities for enhancing creativity, individuals have agency in choosing types and aspects of production that would enable them to recognize and make use of those opportunities.
